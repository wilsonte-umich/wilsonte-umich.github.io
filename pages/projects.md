Tabs below represent the majority, but not all, of the many collaborative efforts 
of the Wilson laboratory. Others we will elaborate on in future site updates
include efforts to:

- understand genomic events during spermatogenesis, with Drs. Sue Hammoud and Agnieszka Lukaszewicz
- reveal the true nature of transgene insertions, with Dr. Zach Freeman
- develop novel genomic technologies for accurate single-molecule SV detection genome-wide
