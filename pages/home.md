Welcome! I am Thomas E. Wilson, M.D. Ph.D., 
Professor of Pathology and Human Genetics 
at the University of Michigan Medical School.

I am a molecular genetic pathologist active in the clinic
with related research interests that include 
basic studies of yeast double-strand break repair, 
mechanisms of mammalian chromosomal instability,
genomic technologies in core facilities, and
bioinformatics, including projects aimed at standardizing and
sharing data analysis tools. 

Education and mentorship of diverse trainees
is critical to our mission and I 
direct classes and UROP and other 
research projects related to molecular genetics, 
translational research, and bioinformatics.

Please explore these pages to learn more about our goals
to advance understanding of the genetic processes that cause
mutations associated with human diseases by detecting them
in the clinical laboratory, exploring their mechanisms 
in the research laboratory, and developing resources 
to help students and other researchers do the same.
