## Template description

The **umich-labs-template** is a starting point for a research laboratory's or project's 
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) 
web site using the [umich-labs](https://github.com/wilsonte-umich/umich-labs) Jekyll theme.

This template uses a permanent fork of the [petridish](https://github.com/peterdesmet/petridish) theme, with extensive modifications from that base but with an overall similar look and feel.

## Template usage

### Create a new repository from this template

**To get started quickly**, [click here to create a new repository from this template](https://github.com/wilsonte-umich/umich-labs-template/generate).

You will be prompted for the user and name of the repository you would like to create.
We recommend that you use 'USER_NAME.github.io' as the name of your repository, e.g., to create repository https://github.com/USER_NAME/USER_NAME.github.io.
That way, your web site will be available through the URL https://USER_NAME.github.io.
  
### Activate your web page on github.io
  
Activate your new web site for loading via github.io as follows:

- navigate to your new repository on GitHub
- click "Settings"
- click the "Pages" tab on the left
- edit the "Source" to be branch 'main' and folder '/root'
- click 'Save'
  
After a minute or two, your site will be live at the link indicated on
Settings / Pages.  It will track your respository to keep your site up
to date whenever you push or merge content changes into the 'main' branch.

You can edit files directly within GitHub, or by cloning the repository
to your local computer and editing and pushing changes from there.

### Configure your new repository's basic information

Open and edit the following files, following the instructions in the comments
regarding which specific lines you should edit to match your needs:

- _config.yml
- _data/base/footer.yml
- _data/base/navigation.yml
- LICENSE (to add your name on the Copyright line)
- README.md (to replace these instructions, if desired)

### Write your web site's contents

your new repo. They create the contents of your web page (the
programming underlying the web site is provided by the umich-labs theme).
