#### Overview

KLIPP Tx is an an exciting and innovative new concept in cancer therapeutics 
developed by our friend, colleague, and frequent collaborator, Dr. Mats Ljungman.
The core concept is that nearly all human cancers have genomic structural variants 
(SVs) unique to just that tumor, which provide a potential therapeutic intervention
if those SV junctions could be specifically targeted with CRISPR.

A central need in KLIPP is efficiently finding well-behaved SV junctions and 
characterizing them at the base-pair level so that guide RNAs can be designed.
Characterizing SV junctions is something the Wilson lab does well, so we are 
helping coordinate the bioinformatics efforts, just one part of this 
multi-disciplinary team.

We all hope the initial proof of principle studies Mats has reported

therapeutic option for patients.
