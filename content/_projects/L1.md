#### Overview

Dr. Wilson was pleased to act as co-mentor, along with Dr. John Moran, to Diane Flasch in a collaboration
that revealed that LINE-1 (L1) elements retrotranspose promiscously in the genome, but with a bias
relative to replication orientation that suggests that L1 mainly inserts into the genome during S phase of the cell cycle.
