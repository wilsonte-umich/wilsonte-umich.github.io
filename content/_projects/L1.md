#### Overview

Dr. Wilson was pleased to act as co-mentor to Diane Flasch, along with Dr. John Moran, in a collaboration
that revealed that LINE-1 (L1) retroelements transpose promiscously in the genome, but with a bias
relative to replication direction that suggests that L1 mainly inserts into the genome during S phase
of the cell cycle.
