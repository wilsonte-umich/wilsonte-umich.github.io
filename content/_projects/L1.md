#### Overview

Dr. Wilson was pleased to act as co-mentor, along with Dr. John Moran, to Diane Flasch in a collaboration
that revealed that LINE-1 (L1) elements retrotranspose promiscuously in the genome, but with a bias
relative to replication orientation that suggests that L1 mainly inserts into the genome during S phase of the cell cycle.

More recently, Dr. Moran and others have continued this work to examine specific chromosome biases
that appear to result from these replication-dependent effects. We hope to report more here soon.
