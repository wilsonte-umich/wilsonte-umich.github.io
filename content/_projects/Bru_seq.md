#### Overview

Bru-seq is a family of related technologies for exploring the dynamics of transcription biology in mammalian cells, which are related by the selection and sequencing of only RNA molecules that were metabolically labelled during an exposure of the cells to bromouridine (Bru). 

Dr. Wilson has worked for more than a decade with Bru-seq inventor and project leader, Dr. Mats Ljungman, to help develop the associated tools for data analysis. The pipeline and browser that Dr. Wilson mainly developed have served the needs of researchers worldwide, most recently in work done within the ENCODE Project (publications pending).
