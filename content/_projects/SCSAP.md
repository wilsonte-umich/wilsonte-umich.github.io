#### Overview

The Single Cell Spatial Analysis Program (SCSAP) works to develop the University of Michigan into a recognized leader in applying high-resolution spatially-resolved multiâ€‘omic analysis within individual cells and in cells within tissues to drive next-generation solutions in biology and human health. We achieve this goal by:

- recruiting faculty experts to Michigan across the spatial analysis domains of technology development, data analysis and biological application
- empowering Michigan researchers to use leading edge spatial technologies by supporting wet and dry lab core services
- breaking down barriers by providing pilot funding and technical support
- promoting communication and collaboration by building a community of researchers who are active and interested in using spatial analysis

Dr. Wilson acts a co-PI of the SCSAP, along with Drs. Evan Keller, Jun Li, Sunitha Nagrath, Justin Colacino and Arvind Rao.

#### Connection to Wilson research efforts

I pursued a leadership role in the SCSAP in part due to its close ties with the [Advanced Genomics Core](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/projects/advanced-genomics-core/). However, we also have a (perhaps lofty) goal of advancing the state of DNA monitoring, _i.e._, mutation detection, within tissues. Current spatial technologies mainly focus on RNA as a more abundant and more easily measured target. In recent years, we have developed extensive expertise in single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and are interested in applying those skill sets to intact tissue to probe how tissue factors such as microenvironments influence the accumulation of the somatic mutations that eventually lead to cancer and other outcomes.
