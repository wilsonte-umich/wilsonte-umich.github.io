#### Overview

The Michigan Data Interface (MDI) is a standardized framework for developing, installing and running HPC data analysis pipelines and interactive R Shiny visualization applications. 

Dr. Wilson is the lead developer of the MDI and uses it as a platform for training UM researchers in best data management and analysis practices, including (but not limited to) running an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Project (UROP) in which students are helping to develop the MDI's tools.

At this point, the Wilson lab uses the MDI in all our projects to rapidly bring on and develop many new data analysis pipelines in a way that is implicitly version controlled, stable, and shareable before and at publication time. It was purpose-developed to solve many of the most common problems faced by academic and other laboratories. 

In short, it works and has been stable for years, check it out!
