After substantial alpha development, we are thrilled to 
announce the first public, open-source release of all of the main code
repositories associated with the **Michigan Data Interface**
collaborative code project. They are now freely available for anyone
to quickly implement and share highly modular data analysis pipelines
and interactive, graphical web tools.

Please see the following links for access to the 
repositories on GitHub and for more information.

- [MDI GitHub Organization](https://github.com/MiDataInt)

- [MDI Main Documentation Page](https://midataint.github.io/docs/overview/)

This announcement should be considered a beta release. 
We still have work to do to extend the documentation,
but the pieces are there and sufficiently documented
for anyone to get going. With more community users
we will be able to work through the remaining 
implementation bugs.
