We are thrilled to welcome Jeanmarie Mishler to our yeast DNA repair group!

Jeanmarie completed her Master's degree at Eastern Michigan University with 
former Michigan graduate student 
[Anne Casper](https://www.emich.edu/biology/faculty/a-casper.php), who we know and love,
where she learned the basics of yeast DNA repair research.

Most recently, Jeanmarie has worked in clinical genomics, where she learned
valuable skills but found herself wanting to apply them more actively
to scientific problems in the basic sciences. We look forward to working with 
her to do just that.
