It's a new year, with [new funding](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/funding/) on [continuing projects](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/projects/)!

Our yeast DNA repair grant was funded in late 2022. We've recently added
[Mikael Dunn](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/people/) 
and seek a postdoctoral fellow or graduate student to lead our genomics efforts in yeast.

We also got great scores on our mammalian CNV mechanisms grant and expect it to be funded in early 2023, and are similarly seeking a second postdoctoral fellow or graduate student to lead projects at the interface of cancer biology and genome instability mechanisms. 

**Project areas** include:
- high-resolution analysis of double-strand break resection
- high-throughput genomic studies of the nuclear biology of chromosomal translocation
- contributions of different end joining mechanisms to chromosome rearrangement
- contributions of transcription and replication to differential susceptibility, i.e., fragility of chromosome regions
- the intersection of metabolism and DNA repair
- your own related interest areas in DNA repair and molecular genetics

**Successful candidates** will bring:
- an enthusiastic interest in molecular genetics and mutagenesis
- a willingness to learn new things, in both the wet and dry labs
- team spirit in pursuit of our goals
- (preferred) for yeast project: experience working with yeast and/or genomic approaches 
- (preferred) for CNV project: experience working with tissue culture and/or human tissues 

Our research group is diverse and our positions are ideal for:
- **beginners**: people seeking to get their feet wet in molecular genetics research and bioinformatics - many people "cut their teeth" on yeast projects like ours.
- **fellows**: experienced researchers seeking to
apply next-generation approaches to important problems in DNA repair - there is great potential for career-launching innovation.
