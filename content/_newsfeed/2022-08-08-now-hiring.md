With good news on a recently submitted grant, we are actively
seeking outstanding candidates to work on our yeast DNA repair projects.

**Project areas** include:
- high-resolution analysis of double-strand break resection
- high-throughput genomic studies of the nuclear biology of chromosomal translocation
- the intersection of metabolism and DNA repair
- your own interest areas in DNA repair and genetics approachable in yeast

**Successful candidates** will bring:
- an enthusiastic interest in molecular genetics and mutagenesis
- a willingness to learn new things, in both the wet and dry labs
- team spirit in pursuit of our goals
- (preferred) experience working with yeast and/or genomic approaches 

Our research group is diverse and our positions are ideal for:
- **beginners**: people seeking to get their feet wet in molecular genetics research and bioinformatics - many people "cut their teeth" on projects like these.
- **fellows**: experienced yeast researchers seeking to
apply next-generation approaches to important problems in DNA repair - there is great potential for career-launching innovation.
