We are happy to report that our study of yeast DSB 5' resection at base-pair
resolution has been published in Nucleic Acids Research. It uses
a next generation sequencing approach to show precisely how a DSB initiates
5' resection in yeast via a controlled Mre11-dependent internal cleavage.

Congratulations, Dominic!
