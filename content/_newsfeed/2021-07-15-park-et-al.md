Our most recent paper addressing mechanisms of CNV formation at large, transcribed genes has appeared in Nucleic Acids Research.

Park et al. report that transcription of a large gene is indeed essential for its instability under replication stress, as revealed by promoter ablation experiments. That affect correlates closely with replication delays seen under stress when transcribed, but not with R-loop levels, which are always low in the body of these genes. 

Congratulations to the many people who contributed to this true team study!
