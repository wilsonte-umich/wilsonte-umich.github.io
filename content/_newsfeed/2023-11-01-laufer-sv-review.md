Please see our new, comprehensive review of the structural variant (SV) field, 
including
- what SVS are, and how they are informed
- the many methods used to find and characterize them, with a focus on long-molecule technologies
- their impacts on biology and genomic sciences
- perspectives and challenges for the future, especially in the clinical context

The review is not a quick read - it is a nuts-to-bolts consideration
of genomic structural assessment that combines historical and state-of-the-art
approaches and basic science and clinical perspectives. 

Congratulations to Vincent Laufer, a resident and fellow in our Clinical Pathology
and Molecular Pathology programs here at Michigan, who is first author. Anyone 
who knows us will see Vincent's clear mark throughout this rigorous analysis!
