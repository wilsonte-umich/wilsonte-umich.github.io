We are thrilled to welcome postdoctoral fellow Alexandra Hawks to our CNV mechanisms group!

Alex is finishing her PhD with 
[Jenny Mason](https://scienceweb.clemson.edu/chg/dr-jennifer-mason/) 
at Clemson University, where she is studying
Rad51-associated mechanisms of action of protein FBH1
in replication fork maintenance and repair.

In a fun twist, Jenny did her PhD with JoAnn Sekiguchi,
our friend and colleague at Michigan. That makes Tom and Tom
Alex's great uncles, or something like that.

We look forward to working with Alex as we expand our
interests in replication-associated mechanisms of CNV formation
beyond common fragile sites, and expand Alex's horizons
to advanced genomic and bioinformatic approaches.
