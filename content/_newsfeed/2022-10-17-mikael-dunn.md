We are thrilled to welcome Mikael Dunn to our yeast DNA repair group!

Mikael was an undergraduate student at Eastern Michigan University with 
former Michigan graduate student 
[Anne Casper](https://www.emich.edu/biology/faculty/a-casper.php), who we know and love,
where he learned the basics of yeast DNA repair research.

He went on to complete a Masters degree at the University of Michigan
and then spent some time in industry working on various yeast-related
applications (even brewing).

In his non-work time, Mikael likes to DJ.

We look forward to working with Mikael on our yeast 
projects, especially making use of his background with
nuclear cross-linking approaches.
