After working toward this goal for many years, our experiments using svCapture
to study structural variant formation during the cell cycle have been published.

See the CNV Mechanisms project summary and the linked publication for details.
Briefly, by using a method that can detect SVs as they form, we show that 
SVs induced in S-phase primarily form in M-phase.

Thanks to everyone involved, but especially to Samreen Ahmed, without whose
great technical skills and dedication this study would not have been possible!
