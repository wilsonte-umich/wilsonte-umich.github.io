Today we officially launched our new web site to share
our goals and research progress!

We are up and functioning, but it will take a while to enter all the necessary
historical content. Apologies to anyone whose work is not yet posted or linked.

If you are interested, we built the site on 
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) 
using our [umich-labs](https://github.com/wilsonte-umich/umich-labs) Jekyll theme.  Check it out
if you like how the site works, it is free, readily available, and easy to use.
