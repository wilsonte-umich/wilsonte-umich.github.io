Our yeast DNA repair grant was funded in late 2022. We've recently added
[Mikael Dunn](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/people/) 
and seek a postdoctoral fellow, senior researcher, or graduate student 
to lead our genomics efforts in yeast.

**Project areas** include:
- high-resolution analysis of double-strand break resection
- high-throughput genomic studies of the nuclear biology of chromosomal translocation
- contributions of different end joining mechanisms to chromosome rearrangement
- the intersection of metabolism and DNA repair
- your own related interest areas in DNA repair and molecular genetics

**Successful candidates** will bring:
- an enthusiastic interest in molecular genetics and mutagenesis
- a willingness to learn new things, in both the wet and dry labs
- team spirit in pursuit of our goals
- (preferred) experience working with yeast and/or genomic approaches 

Our research group is broadly based and our positions are ideal for:
- **beginners**: people seeking to get their feet wet in molecular genetics research and bioinformatics - 
many people "cut their teeth" on yeast projects like ours.
- **fellows**: experienced researchers seeking to
apply next-generation approaches to important problems in DNA repair - 
there is great potential for career-launching innovation.
