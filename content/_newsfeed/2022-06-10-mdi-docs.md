In conjunction with the 
[launch of MDI v1.0.0](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io/newsfeed/mdi-v1-0-0/),
we have now released the completed MDI 
documentation web pages.

- <https://midataint.github.io/>

This new, extended documentation has a complete description of all components required to use and develop MDI pipelines and apps.

Because the MDI has an educational mission, we also created a comprehensive
set of Basic Training modules for people who
are beginners at some or all aspects of MDI-relevant
code development (Git, HPC server, R Shiny, etc.): 

- <https://midataint.github.io/mdi-basic-training/>

We hope these new resources help you tap into 
the many advantages of the rich MDI ecosystem.
