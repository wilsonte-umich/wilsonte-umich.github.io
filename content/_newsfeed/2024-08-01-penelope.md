We are excited to now be able to do long-read DNA sequencing right in our own laboratory!

Our new Oxford Nanopore Technologies P2 Promethion sequencing is now live and generating data.

A primary goal for this new device is to optimize protocols for accurate rare SV junction
detection, which has many potential applications that for our lab are strongly geared toward
novel methods for characterizing SV junctions genome wide.
