Welcome to Joey Stewart our newest postdoctoral fellow!

Joey completed his undergraduate research at Eastern Michigan University with 
former Michigan graduate student 
[Anne Casper](https://www.emich.edu/biology/faculty/a-casper.php). He then 
went on to complete his PhD in Genetics with Lucas Argueso at 
Colorado State University where he did very interesting work on the 
phenomenon of burst mutagenesis. 

Joey will start in the lab by building on his experience with yeast research,
but is interested in quickly expanding his genomics and bioinformatics skills
toward his eventual clinical interest in Laboratory Genetics and Genomics.
