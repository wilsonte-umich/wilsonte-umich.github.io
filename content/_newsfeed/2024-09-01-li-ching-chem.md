We welcome Li-Ching Chen, who goes by her English name Kelly!

Kelly is a student in the Department of Human Genetis Masters Program
directed by our close colleagues Tom Glove and JoAnn Sekiguchi. She
is interested in learning computational bioinformatics and we are happy
to give her the experience on our structural variant sequencing projects.
