  abstract: Impaired replication progression leads to de novo copy number variant
    (CNV)  formation at common fragile sites (CFSs). We previously showed that these
    hotspots  for genome instability reside in late-replicating domains associated
    with large  transcribed genes and provided indirect evidence that transcription
    is a factor in  their instability. Here, we compared aphidicolin (APH)-induced
    CNV and CFS frequency  between wild-type and isogenic cells in which FHIT gene
    transcription was ablated by  promoter deletion. Two promoter-deletion cell lines
    showed reduced or absent CNV  formation and CFS expression at FHIT despite continued
    instability at the NLGN1  control locus. APH treatment led to critical replication
    delays that remained  unresolved in G2/M in the body of many, but not all, large
    transcribed genes, an  effect that was reversed at FHIT by the promoter deletion.
    Altering RNase H1  expression did not change CNV induction frequency and DRIP-seq
    showed a paucity of  R-loop formation in the central regions of large genes, suggesting
    that R-loops are  not the primary mediator of the transcription effect. These
    results demonstrate that  large gene transcription is a determining factor in
    replication stress-induced  genomic instability and support models that CNV hotspots
    mainly result from the  transcription-dependent passage of unreplicated DNA into
    mitosis.

  title: Effects of hydroxyurea on CNV induction in the mouse germline
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 59(8):698-714
  year: 2018
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are important in genome variation and genetic
    disease,  with new mutations arising frequently in the germline and somatic cells.
    Replication  stress caused by aphidicolin and hydroxyurea (HU) is a potent inducer
    of de novo  CNVs in cultured mammalian cells. HU is used extensively for long-term
    management of  sickle cell disease. Here, we examined the effects of HU treatment
    on germline CNVs  in vivo in male mice to explore whether replication stress can
    act as a CNV mutagen  in germline mitotic divisions as in cultured cells and whether
    this would support a  concern for increased CNV mutations in offspring of men
    treated with HU. Several  trials of HU administration were performed by oral gavage
    and subcutaneous pump,  with CNVs characterized in C57BL/6 x C3H/HeJ hybrid mouse
    offspring by microarray  and mate-pair sequencing. HU had a short half-life of
    ~14 min and a narrow dose  window over which studies could be performed while
    maintaining fertility. Tissue  histopathology and reticulocyte micronucleus assays
    verified that doses had a  substantial tissue and genetic toxicity. CNVs were
    readily detected in offspring  that originated in both paternal and maternal mouse
    strains, as de novo and  inherited events. However, HU did not increase CNV formation
    above baseline levels.  These results reveal a high rate of CNV mutagenesis in
    the mouse germline but do not  support the hypothesis that HU would increase CNV
    formation during mammalian  spermatogenesis, perhaps due to highly toxic effects
    on sperm development or  experimental variables related to HU pharmacology in
    mice. Environ. Mol. Mutagen.  59:698-714, 2018. Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title: 'Fragile sites in cancer: more than meets the eye'
  journal: Nat Rev Cancer
  citation: 17(8):489-501
  year: 2017
  url: ~
  abstract: Ever since initial suggestions that instability at common fragile sites
    (CFSs) could  be responsible for chromosome rearrangements in cancers, CFSs and
    associated genes  have been the subject of numerous studies, leading to questions
    and controversies  about their role and importance in cancer. It is now clear
    that CFSs are not  frequently involved in translocations or other cancer-associated
    recurrent gross  chromosome rearrangements. However, recent studies have provided
    new insights into  the mechanisms of CFS instability, their effect on genome instability,
    and their  role in generating focal copy number alterations that affect the genomic
    landscape  of many cancers.

  title: Large transcription units unify copy number variants and common fragile sites
    arising under replication stress
  journal: Genome Res
  citation: 25(2):189-200
  year: 2015
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) resulting from genomic deletions and duplications
    and  common fragile sites (CFSs) seen as breaks on metaphase chromosomes are distinct  forms
    of structural chromosome instability precipitated by replication inhibition.  Although
    they share a common induction mechanism, it is not known how CNVs and CFSs  are
    related or why some genomic loci are much more prone to their occurrence. Here  we
    compare large sets of de novo CNVs and CFSs in several experimental cell systems  to
    each other and to overlapping genomic features. We first show that CNV hotpots  and
    CFSs occurred at the same human loci within a given cultured cell line. Bru-seq  nascent
    RNA sequencing further demonstrated that although genomic regions with low  CNV
    frequencies were enriched in transcribed genes, the CNV hotpots that matched  CFSs
    specifically corresponded to the largest active transcription units in both  human
    and mouse cells. Consistently, active transcription units >1 Mb were robust  cell-type-specific
    predictors of induced CNV hotspots and CFS loci. Unlike most  transcribed genes,
    these very large transcription units replicated late and  organized deletion and
    duplication CNVs into their transcribed and flanking regions,  respectively, supporting
    a role for transcription in replication-dependent lesion  formation. These results
    indicate that active large transcription units drive  extreme locus- and cell-type-specific
    genomic instability under replication stress,  resulting in both CNVs and CFSs
    as different manifestations of perturbed replication  dynamics.

  title: Copy number variants are produced in response to low-dose ionizing radiation
    in cultured cells
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 55(2):103-13
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Despite their importance to human genetic variation and disease, little
    is known  about the molecular mechanisms and environmental risk factors that impact
    copy  number variant (CNV) formation. While it is clear that replication stress
    can lead  to de novo CNVs, for example, following treatment of cultured mammalian
    cells with  aphidicolin (APH) and hydroxyurea (HU), the effect of different types
    of mutagens on  CNV induction is unknown. Here we report that ionizing radiation
    (IR) in the range  of 1.5-3.0 Gy effectively induces de novo CNV mutations in
    cultured normal human  fibroblasts. These IR-induced CNVs are found throughout
    the genome, with the same  hotspot regions seen after APH- and HU-induced replication
    stress. IR produces  duplications at a higher frequency relative to deletions
    than do APH and HU. At most  hotspots, these duplications are physically shifted
    from the regions typically  deleted after APH or HU, suggesting different pathways
    involved in their formation.  CNV breakpoint junctions from irradiated samples
    are characterized by microhomology,  blunt ends, and insertions like those seen
    in spontaneous and APH/HU-induced CNVs  and most nonrecurrent CNVs in vivo. The
    similarity to APH/HU-induced CNVs suggests  that low-dose IR induces CNVs through
    a replication-dependent mechanism, as opposed  to replication-independent repair
    of DSBs. Consistent with this mechanism, a lower  yield of CNVs was observed when
    cells were held for 48 hr before replating after  irradiation. These results predict
    that any environmental DNA damaging agent that  impairs replication is capable
    of creating CNVs.

  abstract: Chromosome rearrangements in B lymphocytes can be initiated by AID-associated

    a compelling  link between replication stress, transcription, and chromosome rearrangements.

  title: Harnessing genomics to identify environmental determinants of heritable disease
  journal: Mutat Res
  citation: 752(1):6-9
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies can now be used to directly measure  heritable
    de novo DNA sequence mutations in humans. However, these techniques have  not
    been used to examine environmental factors that induce such mutations and their  associated
    diseases. To address this issue, a working group on environmentally  induced germline
    mutation analysis (ENIGMA) met in October 2011 to propose the  necessary foundational
    studies, which include sequencing of parent-offspring trios  from highly exposed
    human populations, and controlled dose-response experiments in  animals. These
    studies will establish background levels of variability in germline  mutation
    rates and identify environmental agents that influence these rates and  heritable
    disease. Guidance for the types of exposures to examine come from rodent  studies
    that have identified agents such as cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, ionizing  radiation,
    cigarette smoke, and air pollution as germ-cell mutagens. Research is  urgently
    needed to establish the health consequences of parental exposures on  subsequent
    generations.

  title: De novo CNV formation in mouse embryonic stem cells occurs in the absence
    of Xrcc4-dependent nonhomologous end joining
  journal: PLoS Genet
  citation: 8(9):e1002981
  year: 2012
  url: ~
  abstract: Spontaneous copy number variant (CNV) mutations are an important factor
    in genomic  structural variation, genomic disorders, and cancer. A major class
    of CNVs, termed  nonrecurrent CNVs, is thought to arise by nonhomologous DNA repair
    mechanisms due to  the presence of short microhomologies, blunt ends, or short
    insertions at junctions  of normal and de novo pathogenic CNVs, features recapitulated
    in experimental  systems in which CNVs are induced by exogenous replication stress.
    To test whether  the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand
    break (DSB)  repair is involved in the formation of this class of CNVs, chromosome
    integrity was  monitored in NHEJ-deficient Xrcc4(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES)
    cells following  treatment with low doses of aphidicolin, a DNA replicative polymerase
    inhibitor.  Mouse ES cells exhibited replication stress-induced CNV formation
    in the same manner  as human fibroblasts, including the existence of syntenic
    hotspot regions, such as  in the Auts2 and Wwox loci. The frequency and location
    of spontaneous and  aphidicolin-induced CNV formation were not altered by loss
    of Xrcc4, as would be  expected if canonical NHEJ were the predominant pathway
    of CNV formation. Moreover,  de novo CNV junctions displayed a typical pattern
    of microhomology and blunt end use  that did not change in the absence of Xrcc4.
    A number of complex CNVs were detected  in both wild-type and Xrcc4(-/-) cells,
    including an example of a catastrophic,  chromothripsis event. These results establish
    that nonrecurrent CNVs can be, and  frequently are, formed by mechanisms other
    than Xrcc4-dependent NHEJ.
