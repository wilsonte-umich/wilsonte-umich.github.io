  abstract: Impaired replication progression leads to de novo copy number variant
    (CNV)  formation at common fragile sites (CFSs). We previously showed that these
    hotspots  for genome instability reside in late-replicating domains associated
    with large  transcribed genes and provided indirect evidence that transcription
    is a factor in  their instability. Here, we compared aphidicolin (APH)-induced
    CNV and CFS frequency  between wild-type and isogenic cells in which FHIT gene
    transcription was ablated by  promoter deletion. Two promoter-deletion cell lines
    showed reduced or absent CNV  formation and CFS expression at FHIT despite continued
    instability at the NLGN1  control locus. APH treatment led to critical replication
    delays that remained  unresolved in G2/M in the body of many, but not all, large
    transcribed genes, an  effect that was reversed at FHIT by the promoter deletion.
    Altering RNase H1  expression did not change CNV induction frequency and DRIP-seq
    showed a paucity of  R-loop formation in the central regions of large genes, suggesting
    that R-loops are  not the primary mediator of the transcription effect. These
    results demonstrate that  large gene transcription is a determining factor in
    replication stress-induced  genomic instability and support models that CNV hotspots
    mainly result from the  transcription-dependent passage of unreplicated DNA into
    mitosis.

  title: Co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies differ within genes and between
    cell types
  journal: RNA
  citation: 27(7):829-40
  year: 2021
  url: ~
  abstract: Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome and involves splice
    site  recognition, removal of introns, and ligation of exons. Components of the  spliceosome
    have been shown to interact with the elongating RNA polymerase II  (RNAPII) which
    is thought to allow splicing to occur concurrently with  transcription. However,
    little is known about the regulation and efficiency of  co-transcriptional splicing
    in human cells. In this study, we used Bru-seq and  BruChase-seq to determine
    the co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies of 17,000  introns expressed across
    6 human cell lines. We found that less than half of all  introns across these
    6 cell lines were co-transcriptionally spliced. Splicing  efficiencies for individual
    introns showed variations across cell lines, suggesting  that splicing may be
    regulated in a cell-type specific manner. Moreover, the  splicing efficiency of
    introns varied within genes. The efficiency of  co-transcriptional splicing did
    not correlate with gene length, intron position,  splice site strengths, or the
    intron/neighboring exons GC content. However, we  identified binding signals from
    multiple RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that correlated  with splicing efficiency,
    including core spliceosomal machinery components-such as  SF3B4, U2AF1 and U2AF2
    showing higher binding signals in poorly spliced introns. In  addition, multiple
    RBPs, such as BUD13, PUM1 and SND1, showed preferential binding  in exons that
    flank introns with high splicing efficiencies. The nascent RNA  splicing patterns
    presented here across multiple cell types add to our understanding  of the complexity
    in RNA splicing, wherein RNA-binding proteins may play important  roles in determining
    splicing outcomes in a cell type- and intron-specific manner.

  title: Characterization of novel primary miRNA transcription units in human cells
    using Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing
  journal: NAR Genom Bioinform
  citation: 2(1):lqz014
  year: 2020
  url: ~
  abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key contributors to gene regulatory networks. Because
    miRNAs  are processed from RNA polymerase II transcripts, insight into miRNA regulation  requires
    a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of primary miRNA  transcripts.
    We used Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing and hidden Markov model  segmentation to
    map primary miRNA transcription units (TUs) across 32 human cell  lines, allowing
    us to describe TUs encompassing 1443 miRNAs from miRBase and 438  from MirGeneDB.
    We identified TUs for 61 miRNAs with an unknown CAGE TSS signal for  MirGeneDB
    miRNAs. Many primary transcripts containing miRNA sequences failed to  generate
    mature miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA biosynthesis is under both  transcriptional
    and post-transcriptional control. In addition to constitutive and  cell-type specific
    TU expression regulated by differential promoter usage, miRNA  synthesis can be
    regulated by transcription past polyadenylation sites  (transcriptional read through)
    and promoter divergent transcription (PROMPTs). We  identified 197 miRNA TUs with
    novel promoters, 97 with transcriptional read-throughs  and 3 miRNA TUs that resemble
    PROMPTs in at least one cell line. The miRNA TU  annotation data resource described
    here reveals a greater complexity in miRNA  regulation than previously known and
    provides a framework for identifying cell-type  specific differences in miRNA
    transcription in cancer and cell transition states.

  title: Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity
    with Replication
  journal: Cell
  citation: 177(4):837-851.e28
  year: 2019
  url: ~
  abstract: L1 retrotransposon-derived sequences comprise approximately 17% of the
    human genome.  Darwinian selective pressures alter L1 genomic distributions during
    evolution,  confounding the ability to determine initial L1 integration preferences.
    Here, we  generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered
    L1 insertions  in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate  retrotransposition
    in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1  endonuclease
    activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences,  demonstrated
    that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed  regions,
    or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the  L1
    endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA  replication
    templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime  endonuclease-independent
    L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus,  acquisition of an
    endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate  into replicating
    DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed  retrotransposon.

  title: Effects of hydroxyurea on CNV induction in the mouse germline
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 59(8):698-714
  year: 2018
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are important in genome variation and genetic
    disease,  with new mutations arising frequently in the germline and somatic cells.
    Replication  stress caused by aphidicolin and hydroxyurea (HU) is a potent inducer
    of de novo  CNVs in cultured mammalian cells. HU is used extensively for long-term
    management of  sickle cell disease. Here, we examined the effects of HU treatment
    on germline CNVs  in vivo in male mice to explore whether replication stress can
    act as a CNV mutagen  in germline mitotic divisions as in cultured cells and whether
    this would support a  concern for increased CNV mutations in offspring of men
    treated with HU. Several  trials of HU administration were performed by oral gavage
    and subcutaneous pump,  with CNVs characterized in C57BL/6 x C3H/HeJ hybrid mouse
    offspring by microarray  and mate-pair sequencing. HU had a short half-life of
    ~14 min and a narrow dose  window over which studies could be performed while
    maintaining fertility. Tissue  histopathology and reticulocyte micronucleus assays
    verified that doses had a  substantial tissue and genetic toxicity. CNVs were
    readily detected in offspring  that originated in both paternal and maternal mouse
    strains, as de novo and  inherited events. However, HU did not increase CNV formation
    above baseline levels.  These results reveal a high rate of CNV mutagenesis in
    the mouse germline but do not  support the hypothesis that HU would increase CNV
    formation during mammalian  spermatogenesis, perhaps due to highly toxic effects
    on sperm development or  experimental variables related to HU pharmacology in
    mice. Environ. Mol. Mutagen.  59:698-714, 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Ever since initial suggestions that instability at common fragile sites
    (CFSs) could  be responsible for chromosome rearrangements in cancers, CFSs and
    associated genes  have been the subject of numerous studies, leading to questions
    and controversies  about their role and importance in cancer. It is now clear
    that CFSs are not  frequently involved in translocations or other cancer-associated
    recurrent gross  chromosome rearrangements. However, recent studies have provided
    new insights into  the mechanisms of CFS instability, their effect on genome instability,
    and their  role in generating focal copy number alterations that affect the genomic
    landscape  of many cancers.

  title: Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the ionizing radiation
    response by ATM and p53
  journal: Sci Rep
  citation: 7:43598
  year: 2017
  url: ~
  abstract: In response to ionizing radiation (IR), cells activate a DNA damage response
    (DDR)  pathway to re-program gene expression. Previous studies using total cellular
    RNA  analyses have shown that the stress kinase ATM and the transcription factor
    p53 are  integral components required for induction of IR-induced gene expression.
    These  studies did not distinguish between changes in RNA synthesis and RNA turnover
    and  did not address the role of enhancer elements in DDR-mediated transcriptional  regulation.
    To determine the contribution of synthesis and degradation of RNA and  monitor
    the activity of enhancer elements following exposure to IR, we used the  recently
    developed Bru-seq, BruChase-seq and BruUV-seq techniques. Our results show  that
    ATM and p53 regulate both RNA synthesis and stability as well as enhancer  element
    activity following exposure to IR. Importantly, many genes in the  p53-signaling
    pathway were coordinately up-regulated by both increased synthesis and  RNA stability
    while down-regulated genes were suppressed either by reduced synthesis  or stability.
    Our study is the first of its kind that independently assessed the  effects of
    ionizing radiation on transcription and post-transcriptional regulation  in normal
    human cells.

  title: Identifying transcription start sites and active enhancer elements using
    BruUV-seq
  journal: Sci Rep
  citation: 5:17978
  year: 2015
  url: ~
  abstract: BruUV-seq utilizes UV light to introduce transcription-blocking DNA lesions
    randomly  in the genome prior to bromouridine-labeling and deep sequencing of
    nascent RNA. By  inhibiting transcription elongation, but not initiation, pre-treatment
    with UV light  leads to a redistribution of transcription reads resulting in the
    enhancement of  nascent RNA signal towards the 5'-end of genes promoting the identification
    of  transcription start sites (TSSs). Furthermore, transcripts associated with
    arrested  RNA polymerases are protected from 3'-5' degradation and thus, unstable
    transcripts  such as putative enhancer RNA (eRNA) are dramatically increased.
    Validation of  BruUV-seq against GRO-cap that identifies capped run-on transcripts
    showed that most  BruUV-seq peaks overlapped with GRO-cap signal over both TSSs
    and enhancer elements.  Finally, BruUV-seq identified putative enhancer elements
    induced by tumor necrosis  factor (TNF) treatment concomitant with expression
    of nearby TNF-induced genes.  Taken together, BruUV-seq is a powerful new approach
    for identifying TSSs and active  enhancer elements genome-wide in intact cells.

  title: Large transcription units unify copy number variants and common fragile sites
    arising under replication stress
  journal: Genome Res
  citation: 25(2):189-200
  year: 2015
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) resulting from genomic deletions and duplications
    and  common fragile sites (CFSs) seen as breaks on metaphase chromosomes are distinct  forms
    of structural chromosome instability precipitated by replication inhibition.  Although
    they share a common induction mechanism, it is not known how CNVs and CFSs  are
    related or why some genomic loci are much more prone to their occurrence. Here  we
    compare large sets of de novo CNVs and CFSs in several experimental cell systems  to
    each other and to overlapping genomic features. We first show that CNV hotpots  and
    CFSs occurred at the same human loci within a given cultured cell line. Bru-seq  nascent
    RNA sequencing further demonstrated that although genomic regions with low  CNV
    frequencies were enriched in transcribed genes, the CNV hotpots that matched  CFSs
    specifically corresponded to the largest active transcription units in both  human
    and mouse cells. Consistently, active transcription units >1 Mb were robust  cell-type-specific
    predictors of induced CNV hotspots and CFS loci. Unlike most  transcribed genes,
    these very large transcription units replicated late and  organized deletion and
    duplication CNVs into their transcribed and flanking regions,  respectively, supporting
    a role for transcription in replication-dependent lesion  formation. These results
    indicate that active large transcription units drive  extreme locus- and cell-type-specific
    genomic instability under replication stress,  resulting in both CNVs and CFSs
    as different manifestations of perturbed replication  dynamics.

  title: Rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II is associated with specific gene
    features and epigenetic modifications
  journal: Genome Res
  citation: 24(6):896-905
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: The rate of transcription elongation plays an important role in the timing
    of  expression of full-length transcripts as well as in the regulation of alternative  splicing.
    In this study, we coupled Bru-seq technology with  5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-ß-D-ribofuranoside
    (DRB) to estimate the elongation  rates of over 2000 individual genes in human
    cells. This technique, BruDRB-seq,  revealed gene-specific differences in elongation
    rates with a median rate of around  1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid
    elongation rates showed higher densities  of H3K79me2 and H4K20me1 histone marks
    compared to slower elongating genes.  Furthermore, high elongation rates had a
    positive correlation with gene length, low  complexity DNA sequence, and distance
    from the nearest active transcription unit.  Features that negatively correlated
    with elongation rate included the density of  exons, long terminal repeats, GC
    content of the gene, and DNA methylation density in  the bodies of genes. Our
    results suggest that some static gene features influence  transcription elongation
    rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by  epigenetic regulation. The
    BruDRB-seq technique offers new opportunities to  interrogate mechanisms of regulation
    of transcription elongation.

  title: Use of Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq for genome-wide assessment of the synthesis
    and stability of RNA
  journal: Methods
  citation: 67(1):45-54
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Gene expression studies commonly examine total cellular RNA, which only
    provides  information about its steady-state pool of RNA. It remains unclear whether  differences
    in the steady-state reflects variable rates of transcription or RNA  degradation.
    To specifically monitor RNA synthesis and degradation genome-wide, we  developed
    Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq. These assays are based on metabolic pulse-chase  labeling
    of RNA using bromouridine (Bru). In Bru-Seq, recently labeled RNAs are  sequenced
    to reveal spans of nascent transcription in the genome. In BruChase-Seq,  cells
    are chased in uridine for different periods of time following Bru-labeling,  allowing
    for the isolation of RNA populations of specific ages. Here we describe  these
    methodologies in detail and highlight their usefulness in assessing RNA  synthesis
    and stability as well as splicing kinetics with examples of specific genes  from
    different human cell lines.

  title: Copy number variants are produced in response to low-dose ionizing radiation
    in cultured cells
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 55(2):103-13
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Despite their importance to human genetic variation and disease, little
    is known  about the molecular mechanisms and environmental risk factors that impact
    copy  number variant (CNV) formation. While it is clear that replication stress
    can lead  to de novo CNVs, for example, following treatment of cultured mammalian
    cells with  aphidicolin (APH) and hydroxyurea (HU), the effect of different types
    of mutagens on  CNV induction is unknown. Here we report that ionizing radiation
    (IR) in the range  of 1.5-3.0 Gy effectively induces de novo CNV mutations in
    cultured normal human  fibroblasts. These IR-induced CNVs are found throughout
    the genome, with the same  hotspot regions seen after APH- and HU-induced replication
    stress. IR produces  duplications at a higher frequency relative to deletions
    than do APH and HU. At most  hotspots, these duplications are physically shifted
    from the regions typically  deleted after APH or HU, suggesting different pathways
    involved in their formation.  CNV breakpoint junctions from irradiated samples
    are characterized by microhomology,  blunt ends, and insertions like those seen
    in spontaneous and APH/HU-induced CNVs  and most nonrecurrent CNVs in vivo. The
    similarity to APH/HU-induced CNVs suggests  that low-dose IR induces CNVs through
    a replication-dependent mechanism, as opposed  to replication-independent repair
    of DSBs. Consistent with this mechanism, a lower  yield of CNVs was observed when
    cells were held for 48 hr before replating after  irradiation. These results predict
    that any environmental DNA damaging agent that  impairs replication is capable
    of creating CNVs.

  title: Genome-wide transcriptional effects of the anti-cancer agent camptothecin
  journal: PLoS One
  citation: 8(10):e78190
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: The anti-cancer drug camptothecin inhibits replication and transcription
    by trapping  DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) covalently to DNA in a "cleavable complex".
    To examine  the effects of camptothecin on RNA synthesis genome-wide we used Bru-Seq
    and show  that camptothecin treatment primarily affected transcription elongation.
    We also  observed that camptothecin increased RNA reads past transcription termination
    sites  as well as at enhancer elements. Following removal of camptothecin, transcription  spread
    as a wave from the 5'-end of genes with no recovery of transcription apparent  from
    RNA polymerases stalled in the body of genes. As a result, camptothecin  preferentially
    inhibited the expression of large genes such as proto-oncogenes, and  anti-apoptotic
    genes while smaller ribosomal protein genes, pro-apoptotic genes and  p53 target
    genes showed relative higher expression. Cockayne syndrome group B  fibroblasts
    (CS-B), which are defective in transcription-coupled repair (TCR),  showed an
    RNA synthesis recovery profile similar to normal fibroblasts suggesting  that
    TCR is not involved in the repair of or RNA synthesis recovery from  transcription-blocking
    Top1 lesions. These findings of the effects of camptothecin  on transcription
    have important implications for its anti-cancer activities and may  aid in the
    design of improved combinatorial treatments involving Top1 poisons.

  title: Harnessing genomics to identify environmental determinants of heritable disease

  abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies can now be used to directly measure  heritable
    de novo DNA sequence mutations in humans. However, these techniques have  not
    been used to examine environmental factors that induce such mutations and their  associated
    diseases. To address this issue, a working group on environmentally  induced germline
    mutation analysis (ENIGMA) met in October 2011 to propose the  necessary foundational
    studies, which include sequencing of parent-offspring trios  from highly exposed
    human populations, and controlled dose-response experiments in  animals. These
    studies will establish background levels of variability in germline  mutation
    rates and identify environmental agents that influence these rates and  heritable
    disease. Guidance for the types of exposures to examine come from rodent  studies
    that have identified agents such as cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, ionizing  radiation,
    cigarette smoke, and air pollution as germ-cell mutagens. Research is  urgently
    needed to establish the health consequences of parental exposures on  subsequent
    generations.

  title: De novo CNV formation in mouse embryonic stem cells occurs in the absence
    of Xrcc4-dependent nonhomologous end joining

  abstract: Spontaneous copy number variant (CNV) mutations are an important factor
    in genomic  structural variation, genomic disorders, and cancer. A major class
    of CNVs, termed  nonrecurrent CNVs, is thought to arise by nonhomologous DNA repair
    mechanisms due to  the presence of short microhomologies, blunt ends, or short
    insertions at junctions  of normal and de novo pathogenic CNVs, features recapitulated
    in experimental  systems in which CNVs are induced by exogenous replication stress.
    To test whether  the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand
    break (DSB)  repair is involved in the formation of this class of CNVs, chromosome
    integrity was  monitored in NHEJ-deficient Xrcc4(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES)
    cells following  treatment with low doses of aphidicolin, a DNA replicative polymerase
    inhibitor.  Mouse ES cells exhibited replication stress-induced CNV formation
    in the same manner  as human fibroblasts, including the existence of syntenic
    hotspot regions, such as  in the Auts2 and Wwox loci. The frequency and location
    of spontaneous and  aphidicolin-induced CNV formation were not altered by loss
    of Xrcc4, as would be  expected if canonical NHEJ were the predominant pathway
    of CNV formation. Moreover,  de novo CNV junctions displayed a typical pattern
    of microhomology and blunt end use  that did not change in the absence of Xrcc4.
    A number of complex CNVs were detected  in both wild-type and Xrcc4(-/-) cells,
    including an example of a catastrophic,  chromothripsis event. These results establish
    that nonrecurrent CNVs can be, and  frequently are, formed by mechanisms other
    than Xrcc4-dependent NHEJ.
