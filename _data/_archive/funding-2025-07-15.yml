  title: Diversification of cortical function in health and disease via developmentally
    programmed deletions in large, brain-specific genes
  description: We hypothesized for years that large brain-specific genes will harbor
    replication-stress-induced structural variants (SVs); this project aims to definitively
    determine the burden of such mutations using new error-suppressed whole genome
    sequencing approaches.
