  abstract: Error-corrected sequencing of genomic targets enriched by probe-based capture has become a standard approach for detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletions (indels) present at very low variant allele frequencies. Less attention has been given to strategies for comparable detection of rare structural variant (SV) junctions, where different error mechanisms must be addressed. Working from cell samples with known SV properties, we demonstrate that Duplex Sequencing (DuplexSeq), which demands confirmation of variants on both strands of a source DNA molecule, eliminates false SV junctions arising from chimeric PCR. DuplexSeq could not address frequent intermolecular ligation artifacts that arise during Y-adapter addition prior to strand denaturation without requiring multiple source molecules. In contrast, tagmentation libraries coupled with data filtering based on strand family size greatly reduced both artifact classes and enabled efficient and specific detection of even single-molecule SV junctions. The throughput of SV capture sequencing (svCapture) and the high base-level accuracy of DuplexSeq provided detailed views of the microhomology profile and limited occurrence of de novo SNVs near the junctions of hundreds of sub-clonal and newly created SVs, suggesting end joining as a predominant formation mechanism. The open source svCapture pipeline enables rare SV detection as a routine addition to SNVs/indels in properly prepared capture sequencing libraries.

  abstract: Impaired replication progression leads to de novo copy number variant
    (CNV)  formation at common fragile sites (CFSs). We previously showed that these
    hotspots  for genome instability reside in late-replicating domains associated
    with large  transcribed genes and provided indirect evidence that transcription
    is a factor in  their instability. Here, we compared aphidicolin (APH)-induced
    CNV and CFS frequency  between wild-type and isogenic cells in which FHIT gene
    transcription was ablated by  promoter deletion. Two promoter-deletion cell lines
    showed reduced or absent CNV  formation and CFS expression at FHIT despite continued
    instability at the NLGN1  control locus. APH treatment led to critical replication
    delays that remained  unresolved in G2/M in the body of many, but not all, large
    transcribed genes, an  effect that was reversed at FHIT by the promoter deletion.
    Altering RNase H1  expression did not change CNV induction frequency and DRIP-seq
    showed a paucity of  R-loop formation in the central regions of large genes, suggesting
    that R-loops are  not the primary mediator of the transcription effect. These
    results demonstrate that  large gene transcription is a determining factor in
    replication stress-induced  genomic instability and support models that CNV hotspots
    mainly result from the  transcription-dependent passage of unreplicated DNA into
    mitosis.

  title: Mapping yeast mitotic 5' resection at base resolution reveals the sequence
    and positional dependence of nucleases in vivo
  journal: Nucleic Acids Res
  citation: gkab597
  year: 2021
  url: ~
  abstract: Resection of the 5'-terminated strand at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
    is the  critical regulated step in the transition to homologous recombination.
    Recent  studies have described a multi-step model of DSB resection where endonucleolytic  cleavage
    mediated by Mre11 and Sae2 leads to further degradation mediated by  redundant
    pathways catalyzed by Exo1 and Sgs1/Dna2. These models have not been well  tested
    at mitotic DSBs in vivo because most methods used to monitor resection cannot  precisely
    map early cleavage events. Here we report resection monitoring with  high-throughput
    sequencing using molecular identifiers, allowing exact counting of  cleaved 5'
    ends at base resolution. Mutant strains, including exo1<U+0394>, mre11-H125N and  exo1<U+0394>
    sgs1<U+0394>, revealed a major Mre11-dependent cleavage position 60-70 bp from
    the  DSB end whose exact position depended on local sequence. They further revealed
    an  Exo1-dependent pause point approximately 200 bp from the DSB. Suppressing
    resection  extension in exo1<U+0394> sgs1<U+0394> yeast exposed a footprint of
    regions where cleavage was  restricted within 119 bp of the DSB. These results
    provide detailed in vivo views of  prevailing models of DSB resection and extend
    them to show the combined influence of  sequence specificity and access restrictions
    on Mre11 and Exo1 nucleases.

  title: Co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies differ within genes and between
    cell types
  journal: RNA
  citation: 27(7):829-40
  year: 2021
  url: ~
  abstract: Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome and involves splice
    site  recognition, removal of introns, and ligation of exons. Components of the  spliceosome
    have been shown to interact with the elongating RNA polymerase II  (RNAPII) which
    is thought to allow splicing to occur concurrently with  transcription. However,
    little is known about the regulation and efficiency of  co-transcriptional splicing
    in human cells. In this study, we used Bru-seq and  BruChase-seq to determine
    the co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies of 17,000  introns expressed across
    6 human cell lines. We found that less than half of all  introns across these
    6 cell lines were co-transcriptionally spliced. Splicing  efficiencies for individual
    introns showed variations across cell lines, suggesting  that splicing may be
    regulated in a cell-type specific manner. Moreover, the  splicing efficiency of
    introns varied within genes. The efficiency of  co-transcriptional splicing did
    not correlate with gene length, intron position,  splice site strengths, or the
    intron/neighboring exons GC content. However, we  identified binding signals from
    multiple RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that correlated  with splicing efficiency,
    including core spliceosomal machinery components-such as  SF3B4, U2AF1 and U2AF2
    showing higher binding signals in poorly spliced introns. In  addition, multiple
    RBPs, such as BUD13, PUM1 and SND1, showed preferential binding  in exons that
    flank introns with high splicing efficiencies. The nascent RNA  splicing patterns
    presented here across multiple cell types add to our understanding  of the complexity
    in RNA splicing, wherein RNA-binding proteins may play important  roles in determining
    splicing outcomes in a cell type- and intron-specific manner.

  title: Characterization of novel primary miRNA transcription units in human cells
    using Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing
  journal: NAR Genom Bioinform
  citation: 2(1):lqz014
  year: 2020
  url: ~
  abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key contributors to gene regulatory networks. Because
    miRNAs  are processed from RNA polymerase II transcripts, insight into miRNA regulation  requires
    a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of primary miRNA  transcripts.
    We used Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing and hidden Markov model  segmentation to
    map primary miRNA transcription units (TUs) across 32 human cell  lines, allowing
    us to describe TUs encompassing 1443 miRNAs from miRBase and 438  from MirGeneDB.
    We identified TUs for 61 miRNAs with an unknown CAGE TSS signal for  MirGeneDB
    miRNAs. Many primary transcripts containing miRNA sequences failed to  generate
    mature miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA biosynthesis is under both  transcriptional
    and post-transcriptional control. In addition to constitutive and  cell-type specific
    TU expression regulated by differential promoter usage, miRNA  synthesis can be
    regulated by transcription past polyadenylation sites  (transcriptional read through)
    and promoter divergent transcription (PROMPTs). We  identified 197 miRNA TUs with
    novel promoters, 97 with transcriptional read-throughs  and 3 miRNA TUs that resemble
    PROMPTs in at least one cell line. The miRNA TU  annotation data resource described
    here reveals a greater complexity in miRNA  regulation than previously known and
    provides a framework for identifying cell-type  specific differences in miRNA
    transcription in cancer and cell transition states.

  title: 'Double-strand breaks in motion: implications for chromosomal rearrangement'
  journal: Curr Genet
  citation: 66(1):1-6
  year: 2020
  url: ~
  abstract: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) must be rejoined properly to prevent the
    occurrence  of serious genomic rearrangements associated with many human diseases.  Non-homologous
    end joining (NHEJ) is a DSB repair mechanism known to protect genomic  integrity
    that is also implicated in creating genomic translocations, inversions,  deletions,
    and insertions. We recently investigated the impact of the pre-damage  spatial
    proximity of DSB-bearing loci on the frequency of trans repair by NHEJ and  surprisingly
    found no correlation between them. In this review, we consider various  models
    that might account for these unexpected results. While DSB movement is  necessary
    to explain our findings, many questions remain about the nature and timing  of
    that motion.

  title: Frequency of DNA end joining in trans is not determined by the predamage
    spatial proximity of double-strand breaks in yeast
  journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
  citation: 116(19):9481-9490
  year: 2019
  url: ~
  abstract: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are serious genomic insults that can lead
    to  chromosomal rearrangements if repaired incorrectly. To gain insight into the
    nuclear  mechanisms contributing to these rearrangements, we developed an assay
    in yeast to  measure cis (same site) vs. trans (different site) repair for the
    majority process  of precise nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). In the assay, the
    HO endonuclease gene  is placed between two HO cut sites such that HO expression
    is self-terminated upon  induction. We further placed an additional cut site in
    various genomic loci such  that NHEJ in trans led to expression of a LEU2 reporter
    gene. Consistent with prior  reports, cis NHEJ was more efficient than trans NHEJ.
    However, unlike homologous  recombination, where spatial distance between a single
    DSB and donor locus was  previously shown to correlate with repair efficiency,
    trans NHEJ frequency remained  essentially constant regardless of the position
    of the two DSB loci, even when they  were on the same chromosome or when two trans
    repair events were put in competition.  Repair of similar DSBs via single-strand
    annealing of short terminal direct repeats  showed substantially higher repair
    efficiency and trans repair frequency, but still  without a strong correlation
    of trans repair to genomic position. Our results  support a model in which yeast
    cells mobilize, and perhaps compartmentalize,  multiple DSBs in a manner that
    no longer reflects the predamage position of two  broken loci.

  title: Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity
    with Replication
  journal: Cell
  citation: 177(4):837-851.e28
  year: 2019
  url: ~
  abstract: L1 retrotransposon-derived sequences comprise approximately 17% of the
    human genome.  Darwinian selective pressures alter L1 genomic distributions during
    evolution,  confounding the ability to determine initial L1 integration preferences.
    Here, we  generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered
    L1 insertions  in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate  retrotransposition
    in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1  endonuclease
    activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences,  demonstrated
    that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed  regions,
    or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the  L1
    endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA  replication
    templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime  endonuclease-independent
    L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus,  acquisition of an
    endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate  into replicating
    DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed  retrotransposon.

  title: Identification of Suppressor of Clathrin Deficiency-1 (SCD1) and Its Connection
    to Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  journal: G3 (Bethesda)
  citation: 9(3):867-877
  year: 2019
  url: ~
  abstract: Clathrin is a major coat protein involved in vesicle formation during
    endocytosis  and transport in the endosomal/trans Golgi system. Clathrin is required
    for normal  growth of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in some genetic backgrounds
    deletion  of the clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC1) is lethal. Our lab defined a
    locus referred  to as " s uppressor of c lathrin d eficiency" (SCD1). In the presence
    of the scd1-v  allele ("v" - viable), yeast cells lacking clathrin heavy chain
    survive but grow  slowly, are morphologically abnormal and have many membrane
    trafficking defects. In  the presence of scd1-i ("i"- inviable), chc1<U+2206>
    causes lethality. As a strategy to  identify SCD1, we used pooled linkage analysis
    and whole genome sequencing. Here, we  report that PAL2 (YHR097C) is the SCD1
    locus. pal2<U+2206> is synthetic lethal with chc1<U+2206>;  whereas a deletion
    of its paralog, PAL1, is not synthetic lethal with clathrin  deficiency. Like
    Pal1, Pal2 has two NPF motifs that are potential binding sites for  EH domain
    proteins such as the early endocytic factor Ede1, and Pal2 associates with  Ede1
    Also, GFP-tagged Pal2p localizes to cortical patches containing other immobile  phase
    endocytic coat factors. Overall, our data show that PAL2 is the SCD1 locus and  the
    Pal2 protein has characteristics of an early factor involved in  clathrin-mediated
    endocytosis.

  title: Effects of hydroxyurea on CNV induction in the mouse germline
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 59(8):698-714
  year: 2018
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are important in genome variation and genetic
    disease,  with new mutations arising frequently in the germline and somatic cells.
    Replication  stress caused by aphidicolin and hydroxyurea (HU) is a potent inducer
    of de novo  CNVs in cultured mammalian cells. HU is used extensively for long-term
    management of  sickle cell disease. Here, we examined the effects of HU treatment
    on germline CNVs  in vivo in male mice to explore whether replication stress can
    act as a CNV mutagen  in germline mitotic divisions as in cultured cells and whether
    this would support a  concern for increased CNV mutations in offspring of men
    treated with HU. Several  trials of HU administration were performed by oral gavage
    and subcutaneous pump,  with CNVs characterized in C57BL/6 x C3H/HeJ hybrid mouse
    offspring by microarray  and mate-pair sequencing. HU had a short half-life of
    ~14 min and a narrow dose  window over which studies could be performed while
    maintaining fertility. Tissue  histopathology and reticulocyte micronucleus assays
    verified that doses had a  substantial tissue and genetic toxicity. CNVs were
    readily detected in offspring  that originated in both paternal and maternal mouse
    strains, as de novo and  inherited events. However, HU did not increase CNV formation
    above baseline levels.  These results reveal a high rate of CNV mutagenesis in
    the mouse germline but do not  support the hypothesis that HU would increase CNV
    formation during mammalian  spermatogenesis, perhaps due to highly toxic effects
    on sperm development or  experimental variables related to HU pharmacology in
    mice. Environ. Mol. Mutagen.  59:698-714, 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: Ever since initial suggestions that instability at common fragile sites
    (CFSs) could  be responsible for chromosome rearrangements in cancers, CFSs and
    associated genes  have been the subject of numerous studies, leading to questions
    and controversies  about their role and importance in cancer. It is now clear
    that CFSs are not  frequently involved in translocations or other cancer-associated
    recurrent gross  chromosome rearrangements. However, recent studies have provided
    new insights into  the mechanisms of CFS instability, their effect on genome instability,
    and their  role in generating focal copy number alterations that affect the genomic
    landscape  of many cancers.

  title: Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the ionizing radiation
    response by ATM and p53
  journal: Sci Rep
  citation: 7:43598
  year: 2017
  url: ~
  abstract: In response to ionizing radiation (IR), cells activate a DNA damage response
    (DDR)  pathway to re-program gene expression. Previous studies using total cellular
    RNA  analyses have shown that the stress kinase ATM and the transcription factor
    p53 are  integral components required for induction of IR-induced gene expression.
    These  studies did not distinguish between changes in RNA synthesis and RNA turnover
    and  did not address the role of enhancer elements in DDR-mediated transcriptional  regulation.
    To determine the contribution of synthesis and degradation of RNA and  monitor
    the activity of enhancer elements following exposure to IR, we used the  recently
    developed Bru-seq, BruChase-seq and BruUV-seq techniques. Our results show  that
    ATM and p53 regulate both RNA synthesis and stability as well as enhancer  element
    activity following exposure to IR. Importantly, many genes in the  p53-signaling
    pathway were coordinately up-regulated by both increased synthesis and  RNA stability
    while down-regulated genes were suppressed either by reduced synthesis  or stability.
    Our study is the first of its kind that independently assessed the  effects of
    ionizing radiation on transcription and post-transcriptional regulation  in normal
    human cells.

  title: Mechanisms of glycosylase induced genomic instability
  journal: PLoS One
  citation: 12(3):e0174041
  year: 2017
  url: ~
  abstract: Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) initiates base excision repair
    (BER) to  guard against mutations by excising alkylated and deaminated purines.  Counterintuitively,
    increased expression of AAG has been implicated in increased  rates of spontaneous
    mutation in microsatellite repeats. This microsatellite mutator  phenotype is
    consistent with a model in which AAG excises bulged (unpaired) bases,  altering
    repeat length. To directly test the role of base excision in AAG-induced  mutagenesis,
    we conducted mutation accumulation experiments in yeast overexpressing  different
    variants of AAG and detected mutations via high-depth genome resequencing.  We
    also developed a new software tool, hp_caller, to perform accurate genotyping
    at  homopolymeric repeat loci. Overexpression of wild-type AAG elevated indel
    mutations  in homopolymeric sequences distributed throughout the genome. However,
    catalytically  inactive variants (E125Q/E125A) caused equal or greater increases
    in frameshift  mutations. These results disprove the hypothesis that base excision
    is the key step  in mutagenesis by overexpressed wild-type AAG. Instead, our results
    provide  additional support for the previously published model wherein overexpressed
    AAG  interferes with the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. In addition to the above
    results,  we observed a dramatic mutator phenotype for N169S AAG, which has increased
    rates of  excision of undamaged purines. This mutant caused a 10-fold increase
    in point  mutations at G:C base pairs and a 50-fold increase in frameshifts in
    A:T  homopolymers. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to consider
    the  relative activities and abundance of many DNA replication and repair proteins
    when  considering mutator phenotypes, as they are relevant to the development
    of cancer  and its resistance to treatment.

  title: Overhang polarity of chromosomal double-strand breaks impacts kinetics and
    fidelity of yeast non-homologous end joining
  journal: Nucleic Acids Res
  citation: 44(6):2769-81
  year: 2016
  url: ~
  abstract: Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway for DNA double-strand  breaks
    (DSBs) in cells with limited 5' resection. To better understand how overhang  polarity
    of chromosomal DSBs affects NHEJ, we made site-specific 5'-overhanging DSBs  (5'
    DSBs) in yeast using an optimized zinc finger nuclease at an efficiency that  approached
    HO-induced 3' DSB formation. When controlled for the extent of DSB  formation,
    repair monitoring suggested that chromosomal 5' DSBs were rejoined more  efficiently
    than 3' DSBs, consistent with a robust recruitment of NHEJ proteins to  5' DSBs.
    Ligation-mediated qPCR revealed that Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 rapidly modified 5'  DSBs
    and facilitated protection of 3' DSBs, likely through recognition of overhang  polarity
    by the Mre11 nuclease. Next-generation sequencing revealed that NHEJ at 5'  DSBs
    had a higher mutation frequency, and validated the differential requirement of  Pol4
    polymerase at 3' and 5' DSBs. The end processing enzyme Tdp1 did not impact  joining
    fidelity at chromosomal 5' DSBs as in previous plasmid studies, although  Tdp1
    was recruited to only 5' DSBs in a Ku-independent manner. These results suggest  distinct
    DSB handling based on overhang polarity that impacts NHEJ kinetics and  fidelity
    through differential recruitment and action of DSB modifying enzymes.

  title: Identifying transcription start sites and active enhancer elements using
    BruUV-seq
  journal: Sci Rep
  citation: 5:17978
  year: 2015
  url: ~
  abstract: BruUV-seq utilizes UV light to introduce transcription-blocking DNA lesions
    randomly  in the genome prior to bromouridine-labeling and deep sequencing of
    nascent RNA. By  inhibiting transcription elongation, but not initiation, pre-treatment
    with UV light  leads to a redistribution of transcription reads resulting in the
    enhancement of  nascent RNA signal towards the 5'-end of genes promoting the identification
    of  transcription start sites (TSSs). Furthermore, transcripts associated with
    arrested  RNA polymerases are protected from 3'-5' degradation and thus, unstable
    transcripts  such as putative enhancer RNA (eRNA) are dramatically increased.
    Validation of  BruUV-seq against GRO-cap that identifies capped run-on transcripts
    showed that most  BruUV-seq peaks overlapped with GRO-cap signal over both TSSs
    and enhancer elements.  Finally, BruUV-seq identified putative enhancer elements
    induced by tumor necrosis  factor (TNF) treatment concomitant with expression
    of nearby TNF-induced genes.  Taken together, BruUV-seq is a powerful new approach
    for identifying TSSs and active  enhancer elements genome-wide in intact cells.

  title: Large transcription units unify copy number variants and common fragile sites
    arising under replication stress
  journal: Genome Res
  citation: 25(2):189-200
  year: 2015
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) resulting from genomic deletions and duplications
    and  common fragile sites (CFSs) seen as breaks on metaphase chromosomes are distinct  forms
    of structural chromosome instability precipitated by replication inhibition.  Although
    they share a common induction mechanism, it is not known how CNVs and CFSs  are
    related or why some genomic loci are much more prone to their occurrence. Here  we
    compare large sets of de novo CNVs and CFSs in several experimental cell systems  to
    each other and to overlapping genomic features. We first show that CNV hotpots  and
    CFSs occurred at the same human loci within a given cultured cell line. Bru-seq  nascent
    RNA sequencing further demonstrated that although genomic regions with low  CNV
    frequencies were enriched in transcribed genes, the CNV hotpots that matched  CFSs
    specifically corresponded to the largest active transcription units in both  human
    and mouse cells. Consistently, active transcription units >1 Mb were robust  cell-type-specific
    predictors of induced CNV hotspots and CFS loci. Unlike most  transcribed genes,
    these very large transcription units replicated late and  organized deletion and
    duplication CNVs into their transcribed and flanking regions,  respectively, supporting
    a role for transcription in replication-dependent lesion  formation. These results
    indicate that active large transcription units drive  extreme locus- and cell-type-specific
    genomic instability under replication stress,  resulting in both CNVs and CFSs
    as different manifestations of perturbed replication  dynamics.

  title: Yeast DNA ligase IV mutations reveal a nonhomologous end joining function
    of BRCT1 distinct from XRCC4/Lif1 binding
  journal: DNA Repair (Amst)
  citation: 24:37-45
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: LIG4/Dnl4 is the DNA ligase that (re)joins DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
    via  nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), an activity supported by binding of its
    tandem  BRCT domains to the ligase accessory protein XRCC4/Lif1. We screened a
    panel of 88  distinct ligase mutants to explore the structure–function relationships
    of the yeast  Dnl4 BRCT domains and inter-BRCT linker in NHEJ. Screen results
    suggested two  distinct classes of BRCT mutations with differential effects on
    Lif1 interaction as  compared to NHEJ completion. Validated constructs confirmed
    that D800K and  GG(868:869)AA mutations, which target the Lif1 binding interface,
    showed a severely  defective Dnl4–Lif1 interaction but a less consistent and often
    small decrease in  NHEJ activity in some assays, as well as nearly normal levels
    of Dnl4 accumulation  at DSBs. In contrast, mutants K742A and KTT(742:744)ATA,
    which target the ß3-a2  region of the first BRCT domain, substantially decreased
    NHEJ function commensurate  with a large defect in Dnl4 recruitment to DSBs, despite
    a comparatively greater  preservation of the Lif1 interaction. Together, these
    separation-of-function mutants  indicate that Dnl4 BRCT1 supports DSB recruitment
    and NHEJ in a manner distinct from  Lif1 binding and reveal a complexity of Dnl4
    BRCT domain functions in support of  stable DSB association.

  title: Pooled segregant sequencing reveals genetic determinants of yeast pseudohyphal
    growth
  journal: PLoS Genet
  citation: 10(8):e1004570
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: The pseudohyphal growth response is a dramatic morphological transition
    and presumed  foraging mechanism wherein yeast cells form invasive and surface-spread  multicellular
    filaments. Pseudohyphal growth has been studied extensively as a model  of conserved
    signaling pathways controlling stress responses, cell morphogenesis,  and fungal
    virulence in pathogenic fungi. The genetic contribution to pseudohyphal  growth
    is extensive, with at least 500 genes required for filamentation; as such,  pseudohyphal
    growth is a complex trait, and linkage analysis is a classical means to  dissect
    the genetic basis of a complex phenotype. Here, we implemented linkage  analysis
    by crossing each of two filamentous strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (S1278b
    and SK1) with an S288C-derived non-filamentous strain. We then assayed  meiotic
    progeny for filamentation and mapped allelic linkage in pooled segregants by  whole-genome
    sequencing. This analysis identified linkage in a cohort of genes,  including
    the negative regulator SFL1, which we find contains a premature stop codon  in
    the invasive SK1 background. The S288C allele of the polarity gene PEA2, encoding  Leu409
    rather than Met, is linked with non-invasion. In S1278b, the pea2-M409L  mutation
    results in decreased invasive filamentation and elongation, diminished  activity
    of a Kss1p MAPK pathway reporter, decreased unipolar budding, and  diminished
    binding of the polarisome protein Spa2p. Variation between SK1 and S288C  in the
    mitochondrial inner membrane protein Mdm32p at residues 182 and 262 impacts  invasive
    growth and mitochondrial network structure. Collectively, this work  identifies
    new determinants of pseudohyphal growth, while highlighting the  coevolution of
    protein complexes and organelle structures within a given genome in  specifying
    complex phenotypes.

  title: Rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II is associated with specific gene
    features and epigenetic modifications
  journal: Genome Res
  citation: 24(6):896-905
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: The rate of transcription elongation plays an important role in the timing
    of  expression of full-length transcripts as well as in the regulation of alternative  splicing.
    In this study, we coupled Bru-seq technology with  5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-ß-D-ribofuranoside
    (DRB) to estimate the elongation  rates of over 2000 individual genes in human
    cells. This technique, BruDRB-seq,  revealed gene-specific differences in elongation
    rates with a median rate of around  1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid
    elongation rates showed higher densities  of H3K79me2 and H4K20me1 histone marks
    compared to slower elongating genes.  Furthermore, high elongation rates had a
    positive correlation with gene length, low  complexity DNA sequence, and distance
    from the nearest active transcription unit.  Features that negatively correlated
    with elongation rate included the density of  exons, long terminal repeats, GC
    content of the gene, and DNA methylation density in  the bodies of genes. Our
    results suggest that some static gene features influence  transcription elongation
    rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by  epigenetic regulation. The
    BruDRB-seq technique offers new opportunities to  interrogate mechanisms of regulation
    of transcription elongation.

  title: Use of Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq for genome-wide assessment of the synthesis
    and stability of RNA
  journal: Methods
  citation: 67(1):45-54
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Gene expression studies commonly examine total cellular RNA, which only
    provides  information about its steady-state pool of RNA. It remains unclear whether  differences
    in the steady-state reflects variable rates of transcription or RNA  degradation.
    To specifically monitor RNA synthesis and degradation genome-wide, we  developed
    Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq. These assays are based on metabolic pulse-chase  labeling
    of RNA using bromouridine (Bru). In Bru-Seq, recently labeled RNAs are  sequenced
    to reveal spans of nascent transcription in the genome. In BruChase-Seq,  cells
    are chased in uridine for different periods of time following Bru-labeling,  allowing
    for the isolation of RNA populations of specific ages. Here we describe  these
    methodologies in detail and highlight their usefulness in assessing RNA  synthesis
    and stability as well as splicing kinetics with examples of specific genes  from
    different human cell lines.

  title: Release from myosin V via regulated recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase
    controls organelle localization
  journal: Dev Cell
  citation: 28(5):520-33
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Molecular motors transport organelles to specific subcellular locations.
    Upon  arrival at their correct locations, motors release organelles via unknown  mechanisms.
    The yeast myosin V, Myo2, binds the vacuole-specific adaptor Vac17 to  transport
    the vacuole from the mother cell to the bud. Here, we show that vacuole  detachment
    from Myo2 occurs in multiple regulated steps along the entire pathway of  vacuole
    transport. Detachment initiates in the mother cell with the phosphorylation  of
    Vac17 that recruits the E3 ligase Dma1 to the vacuole. However, Dma1 recruitment  also
    requires the assembly of the vacuole transport complex and is first observed  after
    the vacuole enters the bud. Dma1 remains on the vacuole until the bud and  mother
    vacuoles separate. Subsequently, Dma1 targets Vac17 for proteasomal  degradation.
    Notably, we find that the termination of peroxisome transport also  requires Dma1.
    We predict that this is a general mechanism that detaches myosin V  from select
    cargoes.

  title: Copy number variants are produced in response to low-dose ionizing radiation
    in cultured cells
  journal: Environ Mol Mutagen
  citation: 55(2):103-13
  year: 2014
  url: ~
  abstract: Despite their importance to human genetic variation and disease, little
    is known  about the molecular mechanisms and environmental risk factors that impact
    copy  number variant (CNV) formation. While it is clear that replication stress
    can lead  to de novo CNVs, for example, following treatment of cultured mammalian
    cells with  aphidicolin (APH) and hydroxyurea (HU), the effect of different types
    of mutagens on  CNV induction is unknown. Here we report that ionizing radiation
    (IR) in the range  of 1.5-3.0 Gy effectively induces de novo CNV mutations in
    cultured normal human  fibroblasts. These IR-induced CNVs are found throughout
    the genome, with the same  hotspot regions seen after APH- and HU-induced replication
    stress. IR produces  duplications at a higher frequency relative to deletions
    than do APH and HU. At most  hotspots, these duplications are physically shifted
    from the regions typically  deleted after APH or HU, suggesting different pathways
    involved in their formation.  CNV breakpoint junctions from irradiated samples
    are characterized by microhomology,  blunt ends, and insertions like those seen
    in spontaneous and APH/HU-induced CNVs  and most nonrecurrent CNVs in vivo. The
    similarity to APH/HU-induced CNVs suggests  that low-dose IR induces CNVs through
    a replication-dependent mechanism, as opposed  to replication-independent repair
    of DSBs. Consistent with this mechanism, a lower  yield of CNVs was observed when
    cells were held for 48 hr before replating after  irradiation. These results predict
    that any environmental DNA damaging agent that  impairs replication is capable
    of creating CNVs.

  title: Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA ligase IV supports imprecise end joining independently
    of its catalytic activity
  journal: PLoS Genet
  citation: 9(6):e1003599
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: DNA ligase IV (Dnl4 in budding yeast) is a specialized ligase used in
    non-homologous  end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although
    point and truncation  mutations arise in the human ligase IV syndrome, the roles
    of Dnl4 in DSB repair  have mainly been examined using gene deletions. Here, Dnl4
    catalytic point mutants  were generated that were severely defective in auto-adenylation
    in vitro and NHEJ  activity in vivo, despite being hyper-recruited to DSBs and
    supporting wild-type  levels of Lif1 interaction and assembly of a Ku- and Lif1-containing
    complex at  DSBs. Interestingly, residual levels of especially imprecise NHEJ
    were markedly  higher in a deletion-based assay with Dnl4 catalytic mutants than
    with a gene  deletion strain, suggesting a role of DSB-bound Dnl4 in supporting
    a mode of NHEJ  catalyzed by a different ligase. Similarly, next generation sequencing
    of repair  joints in a distinct single-DSB assay showed that dnl4-K466A mutation
    conferred a  significantly different imprecise joining profile than wild-type
    Dnl4 and that such  repair was rarely observed in the absence of Dnl4. Enrichment
    of DNA ligase I (Cdc9  in yeast) at DSBs was observed in wild-type as well as
    dnl4 point mutant strains,  with both Dnl4 and Cdc9 disappearing from DSBs upon
    5' resection that was unimpeded  by the presence of catalytically inactive Dnl4.
    These findings indicate that Dnl4  can promote mutagenic end joining independently
    of its catalytic activity, likely by  a mechanism that involves Cdc9.

  title: Repair of double-strand breaks by end joining
  journal: Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol
  citation: 5(5):a012757
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) refers to a set of genome maintenance
    pathways in  which two DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends are (re)joined by apposition,  processing,
    and ligation without the use of extended homology to guide repair.  Canonical
    NHEJ (c-NHEJ) is a well-defined pathway with clear roles in protecting the  integrity
    of chromosomes when DSBs arise. Recent advances have revealed much about  the
    identity, structure, and function of c-NHEJ proteins, but many questions exist  regarding
    their concerted action in the context of chromatin. Alternative NHEJ  (alt-NHEJ)
    refers to more recently described mechanism(s) that repair DSBs in  less-efficient
    backup reactions. There is great interest in defining alt-NHEJ more  precisely,
    including its regulation relative to c-NHEJ, in light of evidence that  alt-NHEJ
    can execute chromosome rearrangements. Progress toward these goals is  reviewed.

  title: Recurrent reciprocal RNA chimera involving YPEL5 and PPP1CB in chronic lymphocytic

  journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
  citation: 110(8):3035-40
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia
    in adults in  the Western hemisphere. Tumor-specific chromosomal translocations,
    characteristic  findings in several human malignancies that directly lead to malignant  transformation,
    have not been identified in CLL. Using paired-end transcriptome  sequencing, we
    identified recurrent and reciprocal RNA chimeras involving yippee  like 5 (YPEL5)
    and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-beta-catalytic subunit  (PPP1CB)
    in CLL. Two of seven index cases (28%) harbored the reciprocal RNA chimeras  in
    our initial screening. Using quantitative real-time PCR (q real-time PCR),  YPEL5/PPP1CB
    and PPP1CB/YPEL5 fusion transcripts were detected in 97 of 103 CLL  samples (95%)
    but not in paired normal samples, benign lymphocytes, or various  unrelated cancers.
    Whole-genome sequencing and Southern blotting demonstrated no  evidence for a
    genomic fusion between YPEL5 and PPP1CB. YPEL5/PPP1CB chimera, when  introduced
    into mammalian cells, expressed a truncated PPP1CB protein that  demonstrated
    diminished phosphatase activity. PPP1CB silencing resulted in enhanced  proliferation
    and colony formation of MEC1 and JVM3 cells, implying a role in the  pathogenesis
    of mature B-cell leukemia. These studies uncover a potential role for  recurrent
    RNA chimeras involving phosphatases in the pathogenesis of a common form  of leukemia.

  title: Coordinated regulation of synthesis and stability of RNA during the acute

  journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
  citation: 110(6):2240-5
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: Steady-state gene expression is a coordination of synthesis and decay
    of RNA through  epigenetic regulation, transcription factors, micro RNAs (miRNAs),
    and RNA-binding  proteins. Here, we present bromouride labeling and sequencing
    (Bru-Seq) and  bromouridine pulse-chase and sequencing (BruChase-Seq) to assess
    genome-wide changes  to RNA synthesis and stability in human fibroblasts at homeostasis
    and after  exposure to the proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The inflammatory  response
    in human cells involves rapid and dramatic changes in gene expression, and  the
    Bru-Seq and BruChase-Seq techniques revealed a coordinated and complex  regulation
    of gene expression both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional  levels.
    The combinatory analysis of both RNA synthesis and stability using Bru-Seq  and
    BruChase-Seq allows for a much deeper understanding of mechanisms of gene  regulation
    than afforded by the analysis of steady-state total RNA and should be  useful
    in many biological settings.

  title: Harnessing genomics to identify environmental determinants of heritable disease
  journal: Mutat Res
  citation: 752(1):6-9
  year: 2013
  url: ~
  abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies can now be used to directly measure  heritable
    de novo DNA sequence mutations in humans. However, these techniques have  not
    been used to examine environmental factors that induce such mutations and their  associated
    diseases. To address this issue, a working group on environmentally  induced germline
    mutation analysis (ENIGMA) met in October 2011 to propose the  necessary foundational
    studies, which include sequencing of parent-offspring trios  from highly exposed
    human populations, and controlled dose-response experiments in  animals. These
    studies will establish background levels of variability in germline  mutation
    rates and identify environmental agents that influence these rates and  heritable
    disease. Guidance for the types of exposures to examine come from rodent  studies
    that have identified agents such as cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, ionizing  radiation,
    cigarette smoke, and air pollution as germ-cell mutagens. Research is  urgently
    needed to establish the health consequences of parental exposures on  subsequent
    generations.

  title: Genome-wide transcriptional effects of the anti-cancer agent camptothecin
  journal: PLoS One
  citation: 8(10):e78190
  year: 2013

  abstract: The anti-cancer drug camptothecin inhibits replication and transcription
    by trapping  DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) covalently to DNA in a "cleavable complex".
    To examine  the effects of camptothecin on RNA synthesis genome-wide we used Bru-Seq
    and show  that camptothecin treatment primarily affected transcription elongation.
    We also  observed that camptothecin increased RNA reads past transcription termination
    sites  as well as at enhancer elements. Following removal of camptothecin, transcription  spread
    as a wave from the 5'-end of genes with no recovery of transcription apparent  from
    RNA polymerases stalled in the body of genes. As a result, camptothecin  preferentially
    inhibited the expression of large genes such as proto-oncogenes, and  anti-apoptotic
    genes while smaller ribosomal protein genes, pro-apoptotic genes and  p53 target
    genes showed relative higher expression. Cockayne syndrome group B  fibroblasts
    (CS-B), which are defective in transcription-coupled repair (TCR),  showed an
    RNA synthesis recovery profile similar to normal fibroblasts suggesting  that
    TCR is not involved in the repair of or RNA synthesis recovery from  transcription-blocking
    Top1 lesions. These findings of the effects of camptothecin  on transcription
    have important implications for its anti-cancer activities and may  aid in the
    design of improved combinatorial treatments involving Top1 poisons.

  title: De novo CNV formation in mouse embryonic stem cells occurs in the absence
    of Xrcc4-dependent nonhomologous end joining
  journal: PLoS Genet
  citation: 8(9):e1002981
  year: 2012
  url: ~
  abstract: Spontaneous copy number variant (CNV) mutations are an important factor
    in genomic  structural variation, genomic disorders, and cancer. A major class
    of CNVs, termed  nonrecurrent CNVs, is thought to arise by nonhomologous DNA repair
    mechanisms due to  the presence of short microhomologies, blunt ends, or short
    insertions at junctions  of normal and de novo pathogenic CNVs, features recapitulated
    in experimental  systems in which CNVs are induced by exogenous replication stress.
    To test whether  the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand
    break (DSB)  repair is involved in the formation of this class of CNVs, chromosome
    integrity was  monitored in NHEJ-deficient Xrcc4(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES)
    cells following  treatment with low doses of aphidicolin, a DNA replicative polymerase
    inhibitor.  Mouse ES cells exhibited replication stress-induced CNV formation
    in the same manner  as human fibroblasts, including the existence of syntenic
    hotspot regions, such as  in the Auts2 and Wwox loci. The frequency and location
    of spontaneous and  aphidicolin-induced CNV formation were not altered by loss
    of Xrcc4, as would be  expected if canonical NHEJ were the predominant pathway
    of CNV formation. Moreover,  de novo CNV junctions displayed a typical pattern
    of microhomology and blunt end use  that did not change in the absence of Xrcc4.
    A number of complex CNVs were detected  in both wild-type and Xrcc4(-/-) cells,
    including an example of a catastrophic,  chromothripsis event. These results establish
    that nonrecurrent CNVs can be, and  frequently are, formed by mechanisms other
    than Xrcc4-dependent NHEJ.

  title: Replication stress and mechanisms of CNV formation
  journal: Curr Opin Genet Dev
  citation: 22(3):204-10
  year: 2012
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are widely distributed throughout the human
    genome,  where they contribute to genetic variation and phenotypic diversity.
    De novo CNVs  are also a major cause of numerous genetic and developmental disorders.
    However,  unlike many other types of mutations, little is known about the genetic
    and  environmental risk factors for new and deleterious CNVs. DNA replication
    errors have  been implicated in the generation of a major class of CNVs, the nonrecurrent
    CNVs.  We have found that agents that perturb normal replication and create conditions
    of  replication stress, including hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, are potent inducers
    of  nonrecurrent CNVs in cultured human cells. These findings have broad implications  for
    identifying CNV risk factors and for hydroxyurea-related therapies in humans.

  title: A recurrent loss-of-function alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) mutation in patients
    with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N)
  journal: Hum Mutat
  citation: 33(1):244-53
  year: 2012
  url: ~
  abstract: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease comprises a heterogeneous group of peripheral  neuropathies
    characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, and impaired sensation in  the extremities.
    Four genes encoding an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) have been  implicated in
    CMT disease. ARSs are ubiquitously expressed, essential enzymes that  ligate amino
    acids to cognate tRNA molecules. Recently, a p.Arg329His variant in the  alanyl-tRNA
    synthetase (AARS) gene was found to segregate with dominant axonal CMT  type 2N
    (CMT2N) in two French families; however, the functional consequence of this  mutation
    has not been determined. To investigate the role of AARS in CMT, we  performed
    a mutation screen of the AARS gene in patients with peripheral neuropathy.  Our
    results showed that p.Arg329His AARS also segregated with CMT disease in a large  Australian
    family. Aminoacylation and yeast viability assays showed that p.Arg329His  AARS
    severely reduces enzyme activity. Genotyping analysis indicated that this  mutation
    arose on three distinct haplotypes, and the results of bisulfite sequencing  suggested
    that methylation-mediated deamination of a CpG dinucleotide gives rise to  the
    recurrent p.Arg329His AARS mutation. Together, our data suggest that impaired  tRNA
    charging plays a role in the molecular pathology of CMT2N, and that patients  with
    CMT should be directly tested for the p.Arg329His AARS mutation.

  title: Hydroxyurea induces de novo copy number variants in human cells
  journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
  citation: 108(42):17360-5
  year: 2011
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are widely distributed throughout the human
    genome,  where they contribute to genetic variation and phenotypic diversity.
    Spontaneous  CNVs are also a major cause of genetic and developmental disorders
    and arise  frequently in cancer cells. As with all mutation classes, genetic and
    environmental  factors almost certainly increase the risk for new and deleterious
    CNVs. However,  despite the importance of CNVs, there is limited understanding
    of these  precipitating risk factors and the mechanisms responsible for a large
    percentage of  CNVs. Here we report that low doses of hydroxyurea, an inhibitor
    of ribonucleotide  reductase and an important drug in the treatment of sickle
    cell disease and other  diseases induces a high frequency of de novo CNVs in cultured
    human cells that  resemble pathogenic and aphidicolin-induced CNVs in size and
    breakpoint structure.  These CNVs are distributed throughout the genome, with
    some hotspots of de novo CNV  formation. Sequencing revealed that CNV breakpoint
    junctions are characterized by  short microhomologies, blunt ends, and short insertions.
    These data provide direct  experimental support for models of replication-error
    origins of CNVs and suggest  that any agent or condition that leads to replication
    stress has the potential to  induce deleterious CNVs. In addition, they point
    to a need for further study of the  genomic consequences of the therapeutic use
    of hydroxyurea.

  title: Comparison of constitutional and replication stress-induced genome structural
    variation by SNP array and mate-pair sequencing
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 187(3):675-83
  year: 2011
  url: ~
  abstract: Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a major source of genetic variation in
    human health  and disease. Previous studies have implicated replication stress
    as a causative  factor in CNV formation. However, existing data are technically
    limited in the  quality of comparisons that can be made between human CNVs and
    experimentally  induced variants. Here, we used two high-resolution strategies-single
    nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) arrays and mate-pair sequencing-to compare CNVs
    that occur  constitutionally to those that arise following aphidicolin-induced
    DNA replication  stress in the same human cells. Although the optimized methods
    provided  complementary information, sequencing was more sensitive to small variants
    and  provided superior structural descriptions. The majority of constitutional
    and all  aphidicolin-induced CNVs appear to be formed via homology-independent
    mechanisms,  while aphidicolin-induced CNVs were of a larger median size than
    constitutional  events even when mate-pair data were considered. Aphidicolin thus
    appears to  stimulate formation of CNVs that closely resemble human pathogenic
    CNVs and the  subset of larger nonhomologous constitutional CNVs.

  title: Discovery of mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by pooled linkage analysis
    and whole-genome sequencing
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 186(4):1127-37
  year: 2010
  url: ~
  abstract: Many novel and important mutations arise in model organisms and human
    patients that  can be difficult or impossible to identify using standard genetic
    approaches,  especially for complex traits. Working with a previously uncharacterized
    dominant  Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant with impaired vacuole inheritance, we
    developed a  pooled linkage strategy based on next-generation DNA sequencing to
    specifically  identify functional mutations from among a large excess of polymorphisms,
    incidental  mutations, and sequencing errors. The VAC6-1 mutation was verified
    to correspond to  PHO81-R701S, the highest priority candidate reported by VAMP,
    the new software  platform developed for these studies. Sequence data further
    revealed the large  extent of strain background polymorphisms and structural alterations
    present in the  host strain, which occurred by several mechanisms including a
    novel Ty insertion.  The results provide a snapshot of the ongoing genomic changes
    that ultimately result  in strain divergence and evolution, as well as a general
    model for the discovery of  functional mutations in many organisms.

  citation: 87(4):560-6
  year: 2010
  url: ~
  abstract: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease comprises a genetically and clinically  heterogeneous
    group of peripheral nerve disorders characterized by impaired distal  motor and
    sensory function. Mutations in three genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases
    (ARSs) have been implicated in CMT disease primarily associated with an  axonal
    pathology. ARSs are ubiquitously expressed, essential enzymes responsible for  charging
    tRNA molecules with their cognate amino acids. To further explore the role  of
    ARSs in CMT disease, we performed a large-scale mutation screen of the 37 human  ARS
    genes in a cohort of 355 patients with a phenotype consistent with CMT. Here we  describe
    three variants (p.Leu133His, p.Tyr173SerfsX7, and p.Ile302Met) in the  lysyl-tRNA
    synthetase (KARS) gene in two patients from this cohort. Functional  analyses
    revealed that two of these mutations (p.Leu133His and p.Tyr173SerfsX7)  severely
    affect enzyme activity. Interestingly, both functional variants were found  in
    a single patient with CMT disease and additional neurological and  non-neurological
    sequelae. Based on these data, KARS becomes the fourth ARS gene  associated with
    CMT disease, indicating that this family of enzymes is specifically  critical
    for axon function.

  title: Regulation of the copper chaperone CCS by XIAP-mediated ubiquitination
  journal: Mol Cell Biol
  citation: 30(8):1923-36
  year: 2010
  url: ~
  abstract: In order to balance the cellular requirements for copper with its toxic
    properties,  an elegant set of mechanisms has evolved to regulate and buffer intracellular  copper.
    The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) protein was recently identified  as
    a copper-binding protein and regulator of copper homeostasis, although the  mechanism
    by which XIAP binds copper in the cytosol is unclear. Here we describe the  identification
    of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) as a mediator  of copper
    delivery to XIAP in cells. We also find that CCS is a target of the E3  ubiquitin
    ligase activity of XIAP, although interestingly, ubiquitination of CCS by  XIAP
    was found to lead to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its  physiologic
    target, superoxide dismutase 1, rather than proteasomal degradation.  Collectively,
    our results reveal novel links among apoptosis, copper metabolism, and  redox
    regulation through the XIAP-CCS complex.

  title: MLH1 deficiency enhances tumor cell sensitivity to ganciclovir
  journal: Cancer Gene Ther
  citation: 16(9):683-92

  abstract: Suicide gene therapy with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
    and  ganciclovir (GCV) is notable for producing multi-log cytotoxicity in a unique  pattern
    of delayed cytotoxicity in S-phase. As hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide  reductase
    inhibitor that activates mismatch repair, can increase sensitivity to GCV,  we
    evaluated the role of MLH1, an essential mismatch repair protein, in GCV  cytotoxicity.
    Using HCT116TK (HSV-TK-expressing) colon carcinoma cells that express  or lack
    MLH1, cell-survival studies demonstrated greater GCV sensitivity in the  MLH1-deficient
    cells, primarily at high concentrations. This could not be explained  by differences
    in GCV metabolism, as the less sensitive MLH1-expresssing cells  accumulated more
    GCV triphosphate and incorporated more of the analog into DNA.  SiRNA suppression
    of MLH1 in U251 glioblastoma or SW480 colon carcinoma cells also  enhanced sensitivity
    to high concentrations of GCV. Studies in a pa nel of yeast  deletion mutants
    confirmed the results with MLH1, and further suggested a role for  homologous
    recombination repair and several cell-cycle checkpoint proteins in GCV  cytotoxicity.
    These data suggest that MLH1 can prevent cytotoxicity with GCV.  Targeting mismatch
    repair-deficient tumors may increase efficacy of this suicide  gene therapy approach
    to cancer treatment.

  title: Recruitment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dnl4-Lif1 complex to a double-strand
    break requires interactions with Yku80 and the Xrs2 FHA domain
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 180(4):1809-19
  year: 2008
  url: ~
  abstract: 'Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in yeast depends on eight different
    proteins in at  least three different functional complexes: Yku70-Yku80 (Ku),
    Dnl4-Lif1-Nej1 (DNA  ligase IV), and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX). Interactions between
    these complexes at DNA  double-strand breaks (DSBs) are poorly understood but
    critical for the completion of  repair. We previously identified two such contacts
    that are redundantly required for  NHEJ, one between Dnl4 and the C terminus of
    Yku80 and one between the  forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Xrs2 and the C
    terminus of Lif1. Here, we first  show that mutation of the Yku80 C terminus did
    not impair Ku binding to DSBs,  supporting specificity of the mutant defect to
    the ligase interaction. We next show  that the Xrs2-Lif1 interaction depends on
    Xrs2 FHA residues (R32, S47, R48, and K75)  analogous to those known in other
    proteins to contact phosphorylated threonines. Two  potential target threonines
    in Lif1 (T417 and T387) were inferred by identifying  regions similar to a site
    in the human Lif1 homolog, XRCC4, known to be bound by the  FHA domain of polynucleotide
    kinase. Mutating these threonines, especially T417,  abolished the Xrs2-Lif1 interaction
    and impaired NHEJ epistatically with Xrs2 FHA  mutation. Combining mutations that
    selectively disable the Yku80-Dnl4 and Xrs2-Lif1  interactions abrogated both
    NHEJ and DNA ligase IV recruitment to a DSB. The  collected results indicate that
    the Xrs-Lif1 and Yku80-Dnl4 interactions are  important for formation of a productive
    ligase-DSB intermediate.'

  year: 2008

  abstract: 'Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is an important DNA double-strand-break
    (DSB)  repair pathway that requires three protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae:  the
    Ku heterodimer (Yku70-Yku80), MRX (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2), and DNA ligase IV  (Dnl4-Lif1),
    as well as the ligase-associated protein Nej1. Here we use chromatin  immunoprecipitation
    from yeast to dissect the recruitment and release of these  protein complexes
    at HO-endonuclease-induced DSBs undergoing productive NHEJ.  Results revealed
    that Ku and MRX assembled at a DSB independently and rapidly after  DSB formation.
    Ligase IV appeared at the DSB later than Ku and MRX and in a strongly  Ku-dependent
    manner. Ligase binding was extensive but slightly delayed in rad50  yeast. Ligase
    IV binding occurred independently of Nej1, but instead promoted  loading of Nej1.
    Interestingly, dissociation of Ku and ligase from unrepaired DSBs  depended on
    the presence of an intact MRX complex and ATP binding by Rad50,  suggesting a
    possible role of MRX in terminating a NHEJ repair phase. This activity  correlated
    with extended DSB resection, but limited degradation of DSB ends occurred  even
    in MRX mutants with persistently bound Ku. These findings reveal the in vivo  assembly
    of the NHEJ repair complex and shed light on the mechanisms controlling DSB  repair

    polymerase utilization in yeast nonhomologous end joining
  journal: DNA Repair (Amst)
  citation: 7(1):67-76
  year: 2008
  url: ~
  abstract: Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) directly rejoins DNA double-strand breaks
    (DSBs)  when recombination is not possible. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA
    polymerase  Pol4 is required for gap filling when a short 3' overhang must prime
    DNA synthesis.  Here, we examined further end variations to test specific hypotheses
    regarding Pol4  usage in NHEJ in vivo. Surprisingly, Pol4 dependence at 3' overhangs
    was reduced  when a nonhomologous 5' flap nucleotide was present across from the
    gap, even though  the mismatched nucleotide was corrected, not incorporated. In
    contrast, a gap with a  5' deoxyribosephosphate (dRP) was as Pol4-dependent as
    a gap with a 5' phosphate,  demonstrating the importance of the downstream base
    in relaxing the Pol4  requirement. Combined with prior observations of Pol4-independent
    NHEJ of nicks with  5' hydroxyls, we suggest that base stacking interactions across
    the broken strands  can stabilize a joint, allowing another polymerase to substitute
    for Pol4. This  model predicts that a unique function of Pol4 is to actively stabilize
    template  strands that lack stacking continuity. We also explored whether NHEJ
    end processing  can occur via short- and long-patch pathways analogous to base
    excision repair.  Results demonstrated that 5' dRPs could be removed in the absence
    of Pol4 lyase  activity. The 5' flap endonuclease Rad27 was not required for repair
    in this or any  situation tested, indicating that still other NHEJ 5' nucleases
    must exist.

  citation: 6(10):1507-16
  year: 2007
  url: ~
  abstract: The nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand break repair
    depends  on DNA ligase IV and its interacting partner protein XRCC4 (Lif1 in yeast).
    A third  yeast protein, Nej1, interacts with Lif1 and supports NHEJ, similar to
    the distantly  related mammalian Nej1 orthologue XLF (also known as Cernunnos).
    XRCC4/Lif1 and  XLF/Nej1 are themselves related and likely fold into similar coiled-coil
    structures,  which suggests many possible modes of interaction between these proteins.
    Using  yeast two-hybrid and co-precipitation methods we examined these interactions
    and the  protein domains required to support them. Results suggest that stable
    coiled-coil  homodimers are a predominant form of XLF/Nej1, just as for XRCC4/Lif1,
    but that  similar heterodimers are not. XLF-XRCC4 and Nej1-Lif1 interactions were
    instead  mediated independently of the coiled coil, and by different regions of
    XLF and Nej1.  Specifically, the globular head of XRCC4/Lif1 interacted with N-
    and C-terminal  domains of XLF and Nej1, respectively. Direct interactions between
    XLF/Nej1 and DNA  ligase IV were also observed, but again appeared qualitatively
    different than the  stable coiled-coil-mediated interaction between XRCC4/Lif1
    and DNA ligase IV. The  implications of these findings for DNA ligase IV function
    are considered in light of  the evolutionary pattern in the XLF/XRCC4 and XLF/Nej1
    family.

  title: Increased recombination between active tRNA genes
  journal: DNA Cell Biol
  citation: 25(6):359-64
  year: 2006
  url: ~
  abstract: Transfer RNA genes are distributed throughout eukaryotic genomes, and
    are frequently  found as multicopy families. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tRNA
    gene transcription by  RNA polymerase III suppresses nearby transcription by RNA
    polymerase II, partially  because the tRNA genes are clustered near the nucleolus.
    We have tested whether  active transcription of tRNA genes might also suppress
    recombination, since  recombination between identical copies of the repetitive
    tRNA genes could delete  intervening genes and be detrimental to survival. The
    opposite proved to be the  case. Recombination between active tRNA genes was elevated,
    but only when both genes  are transcribed. We also tested the effects of tRNA
    genes on recombination between  the direct terminal repeats of a neighboring retrotransposon,
    since most Ty  retrotransposons reside next to tRNA genes, and the selective advantage
    of this  arrangement is not known.

  title: Mutations of the Yku80 C terminus and Xrs2 FHA domain specifically block
    yeast nonhomologous end joining

  abstract: 'The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand break
    repair  requires three protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: MRX  (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2),
    Ku (Ku70-Ku80), and DNA ligase IV (Dnl4-Lif1-Nej1). Much is  known about the interactions
    that mediate the formation of each complex, but little  is known about how they
    act together during repair. A comprehensive yeast two-hybrid  screen of the NHEJ
    factors of S. cerevisiae revealed all known interactions within  the MRX, Ku,
    and DNA ligase IV complexes, as well as three additional, weaker  interactions
    between Yku80-Dnl4, Xrs2-Lif1, and Mre11-Yku80. Individual and combined  deletions
    of the Yku80 C terminus and the Xrs2 forkhead-associated (FHA) domain were  designed
    based on the latter two-hybrid results. These deletions synergistically  blocked
    NHEJ but not the telomere and recombination functions of Ku and MRX,  confirming
    that these protein regions are functionally important specifically for  NHEJ.
    Further mutational analysis of Yku80 identified a putative C-terminal  amphipathic
    alpha-helix that is both required for its NHEJ function and strikingly  similar
    to a DNA-dependent protein kinase interaction motif in human Ku80. These  results
    identify a novel role in yeast NHEJ for the poorly characterized Ku80  C-terminal
    and Xrs2 FHA domains, and they suggest that redundant binding of DNA  ligase IV
    facilitates completion of this DNA repair event.'

  title: DNA joint dependence of pol X family polymerase action in nonhomologous end
    joining
  journal: J Biol Chem
  citation: 280(32):29030-7
  year: 2005
  url: ~
  abstract: DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) can be rejoined directly by the nonhomologous  end-joining
    (NHEJ) pathway of repair. Nucleases and polymerases are required to  promote accurate
    NHEJ when the terminal bases of the DSB are damaged. The same  enzymes also participate
    in imprecise rejoining and joining of incompatible ends,  important mutagenic
    events. Previous work has shown that the Pol X family polymerase  Pol4 is required
    for some but not all NHEJ events that require gap filling in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    Here, we systematically analyzed DSB end configurations  and found that gaps on
    both strands and overhang polarity are the principal factors  that determine whether
    a joint requires Pol4. DSBs with 3'-overhangs and a gap on  each strand strongly
    depended on Pol4 for repair, DSBs with 5'-overhangs of the same  sequence did
    not. Pol4 was not required when 3'-overhangs contained a gap on only  one strand,
    however. Pol4 was equally required at 3'-overhangs of all lengths within  the
    NHEJ-dependent range but was dispensable outside of this range, indicating that  Pol4
    is specific to NHEJ. Loss of Pol4 did not affect the rejoining of DSBs that  utilized
    a recessed microhomology or DSBs bearing 5'-hydroxyls but no gap. Finally,  mammalian
    Pol X polymerases were able to differentially complement a pol4 mutation  depending
    on the joint structure, demonstrating that these polymerases can  participate
    in yeast NHEJ but with distinct properties.

  title: Abrogation of the Chk1-Pds1 checkpoint leads to tolerance of persistent single-strand
    breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 169(4):1833-44
  year: 2005
  url: ~
  abstract: In budding yeast, Apn1, Apn2, Tpp1, and Rad1/Rad10 are important enzymes
    in the  removal of spontaneous DNA lesions. apn1 apn2 rad1 yeast are inviable
    due to  accumulation of abasic sites and strand breaks with 3' blocking lesions.
    We found  that tpp1 apn1 rad1 yeast exhibited slow growth but frequently gave
    rise to  spontaneous slow growth suppressors that segregated as single-gene mutations.
    Using  a candidate gene approach, we identified several tpp1 apn1 rad1 suppressors.  Deleting
    uracil glycosylase suppressed both tpp1 apn1 rad1 and apn1 apn2 rad1 growth  defects
    by reducing the abasic site burden. Mutants affecting the Chk1-Pds1  metaphase-anaphase
    checkpoint only suppressed tpp1 apn1 rad1 slow growth. In  contrast, most S-phase
    checkpoint mutants were synthetically lethal in a tpp1 apn1  rad1 background.
    Epistasis analyses showed an additive effect between chk1 and ung1,  indicating
    different mechanisms of suppression. Loss of Chk1 partially restored  cell-growth
    parameters in tpp1 apn1 rad1 yeast, but at the same time exacerbated  chromosome
    instability. We propose a model in which recombinational repair during S  phase
    coupled with failure of the metaphase-anaphase checkpoint allows for tolerance  of
    persistent single-strand breaks at the expense of genome stability.

  title: Rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks as a function of overhang length
  journal: Mol Cell Biol
  citation: 25(3):896-906
  year: 2005
  url: ~
  abstract: 'The ends of spontaneously occurring double-strand breaks (DSBs) may contain
    various  lengths of single-stranded DNA, blocking lesions, and gaps and flaps
    generated by  end annealing. To investigate the processing of such structures,
    we developed an  assay in which annealed oligonucleotides are ligated onto the
    ends of a linearized  plasmid which is then transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
    Reconstitution of a  marker occurs only when the oligonucleotides are incorporated
    and repair is in  frame, permitting rapid analysis of complex DSB ends. Here,
    we created DSBs with  compatible overhangs of various lengths and asked which
    pathways are required for  their precise repair. Three mechanisms of rejoining
    were observed, regardless of  overhang polarity: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ),
    a Rad52-dependent single-strand  annealing-like pathway, and a third mechanism
    independent of the first two  mechanisms. DSBs with overhangs of less than 4 bases
    were mainly repaired by NHEJ.  Repair became less dependent on NHEJ when the overhangs
    were longer or had a higher  GC content. Repair of overhangs greater than 8 nucleotides
    was as much as 150-fold  more efficient, impaired 10-fold by rad52 mutation, and
    highly accurate. Reducing  the microhomology extent between long overhangs reduced
    their repair dramatically,  to less than NHEJ of comparable short overhangs. These
    data support a model in which  annealing energy is a primary determinant of the
    rejoining efficiency and mechanism.'

  title: Nonhomologous end joining in yeast

  citation: 39:431-51
  year: 2005
  url: ~
  abstract: Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), the direct rejoining of DNA double-strand
    breaks,  is closely associated with illegitimate recombination and chromosomal
    rearrangement.  This has led to the concept that NHEJ is error prone. Studies
    with the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed that this model eukaryote
    has a classical  NHEJ pathway dependent on Ku and DNA ligase IV, as well as alternative
    mechanisms  for break rejoining. The evolutionary conservation of the Ku-dependent
    process  includes several genes dedicated to this pathway, indicating that classical
    NHEJ at  least is a strong contributor to fitness in the wild. Here we review
    how  double-strand break structure, the yeast NHEJ proteins, and alternative rejoining  mechanisms
    influence the accuracy of break repair. We also consider how the balance  between
    NHEJ and homologous repair is regulated by cell state to promote genome  preservation.
    The principles discussed are instructive to NHEJ in all organisms.

  title: Identification of DNA 3'-phosphatase active site residues and their differential
    role in DNA binding, Mg2+ coordination, and catalysis
  journal: Biochemistry
  citation: 43(26):8579-89
  year: 2004
  url: ~
  abstract: DNA 3'-phosphatase (Tpp1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a homologue of
    human  polynucleotide kinase/3'-phosphatase, has been shown to participate in
    DNA damage  repair by removing 3'-phosphate blocking lesions. Tpp1 shows similarity
    to the  l-2-haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of enzymes. By comparison to phosphoserine  phosphatase,
    a well-studied member of this family, we designed conservative and  nonconservative
    substitutions of likely active site residues of Tpp1 and tested them  in a variety
    of assays. From the loss or impairment of activity, we identified D35,  D37, T39,
    S88, K170, D206, and D218 as being involved in Tpp1 catalysis. D35 and  K170 were
    the most critical since maximum inactivation was seen with even  conservative
    mutations. Tpp1 bound DNA through its active site in a Mg(2+)-dependent  manner
    and exhibited a preference for dsDNA. Although Tpp1 bound more strongly to  DNA
    with a free 3' terminus, it also bound well to covalently closed DNA, suggesting  a
    possible lesion scanning mechanism. DNA binding studies further indicated that  Tpp1
    coordinates Mg(2+) through D35 and D206 and contacts the DNA 3' end through  D37.
    The removal of 3'-phosphate involved a phospho-Tpp1 intermediate, and our  results
    support D35 as being the point of covalent attachment. On the basis of these  similarities
    in mutant phenotypes of Tpp1 and phosphoserine phosphatase, we propose  a reaction
    mechanism for Tpp1 which explains its strict phosphate specificity.

  title: The role of yeast DNA 3'-phosphatase Tpp1 and rad1/Rad10 endonuclease in
    processing spontaneous and induced base lesions
  journal: J Biol Chem
  citation: 278(33):31434-43
  year: 2003
  url: ~
  abstract: Tpp1 is a DNA 3'-phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is believed
    to act  during strand break repair. It is homologous to one domain of mammalian  polynucleotide
    kinase/3'-phosphatase. Unlike in yeast, we found that Tpp1 could  confer resistance
    to methylmethane sulfonate when expressed in bacteria that lack  abasic endonuclease/3'-phosphodiesterase
    function. This species difference was due  to the absence of delta-lyase activity
    in S. cerevisiae, since expression of  bacterial Fpg conferred Tpp1-dependent
    resistance to methylmethane sulfonate in  yeast lacking the abasic endonucleases
    Apn1 and Apn2. In contrast, beta-only lyases  increased methylmethane sulfonate
    sensitivity independently of Tpp1, which was  explained by the inability of Tpp1
    to cleave 3' alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. In  parallel experiments, mutations
    of TPP1 and RAD1, encoding part of the Rad1/Rad10  3'-flap endonuclease, caused
    synthetic growth defects in yeast strains lacking Apn1.  In contrast, Fpg expression
    led to a partial rescue of apn1 apn2 rad1 synthetic  lethality by converting lesions
    into Tpp1-cleavable 3'-phosphates. The collected  experiments reveal a profound
    toxicity of strand breaks with irreparable 3' blocking  lesions, and extend the
    function of the Rad1/Rad10 salvage pathway to 3'-phosphates.  They further demonstrate
    a role for Tpp1 in repairing endogenously created  3'-phosphates. The source of
    these phosphates remains enigmatic, however, because  apn1 tpp1 rad1 slow growth
    could be correlated with neither the presence of a yeast  delta-lyase, the activity
    of the 3'-phosphate-generating enzyme Tdp1, nor levels of  endogenous oxidation.

    repair ratio
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 162(2):677-88
  year: 2002
  url: ~
  abstract: We recently described a yeast assay suitable for genetic screening in
    which simple  religation nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and single-strand annealing
    (SSA)  compete for repair of an I-SceI-created double-strand break. Here, the
    required  allele has been introduced into an array of 4781 MATa deletion mutants
    and each  strain screened individually. Two mutants (rad52 and srs2) showed a
    clear increase  in the NHEJ/SSA ratio due to preferential impairment of SSA, but
    no mutant increased  the absolute frequency of NHEJ significantly above the wild-type
    level. Seven  mutants showed a decreased NHEJ/SSA ratio due to frank loss of NHEJ,
    which  corresponded to all known structural/catalytic NHEJ components (yku70,
    yku80, dnl4,  lif1, rad50, mre11, and xrs2); no new mutants in this category were
    identified. A  clearly separable and surprisingly large set of 16 other mutants
    showed partial  defects in NHEJ. Further examination of these revealed that NEJ1
    can entirely  account for the mating-type regulation of NHEJ, but that this regulatory
    role was  distinct from the postdiauxic/stationary-phase induction of NHEJ that
    was deficient  in other mutants (especially doa1, fyv6, and mck1). These results
    are discussed in  the context of the minimal set of required proteins and regulatory
    inputs for NHEJ.

  title: Enhancement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae end-joining efficiency by cell growth
    stage but not by impairment of recombination
  journal: Genetics
  citation: 161(3):1015-27
  year: 2002
  url: ~
  abstract: Cells can repair DNA double-strand breaks by both homologous and nonhomologous  mechanisms.
    To explore the basis of pathway utilization, we developed both plasmid  and chromosomal
    yeast repair assays in which breaks are created with restriction  endonucleases
    so that nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) competes with the  single-strand annealing
    (SSA) recombination pathway, which we show acts with high  efficiency via terminal
    direct repeats of only 28 bp and with reduced but measurable  efficiency at 10
    bp. The chromosomal assay utilizes a novel approach termed suicide  deletion in
    which the endonuclease cleaves its own gene from the chromosome, thereby  ending
    the futile cleavage cycle that otherwise prevents detection of  simple-religation
    events. Eliminating SSA as a possibility in either assay, either  by removal of
    the direct repeat or by mutation of RAD52, increased the relative but  not the
    absolute efficiency of NHEJ. In contrast, the apparent efficiency of NHEJ  was
    specifically increased in the G1 stage of the haploid cell cycle, as well as by  the
    glucose depletion-signaled transition to stationary phase. The combined results  argue
    against a model in which pathway utilization is determined by a passive  competition.
    Instead, they demonstrate an active regulation designed to optimize the  likelihood
    of genome restoration based on cell state.

  title: Repair of DNA strand breaks by the overlapping functions of lesion-specific
    and non-lesion-specific DNA 3' phosphatases
  journal: Mol Cell Biol
  citation: 21(21):7191-8
  year: 2001
  url: ~
  abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases
    Apn1 and  Apn2 act as alternative pathways for the removal of various 3'-terminal
    blocking  lesions from DNA strand breaks and in the repair of abasic sites, which
    both result  from oxidative DNA damage. Here we demonstrate that Tpp1, a homologue
    of the 3'  phosphatase domain of polynucleotide kinase, is a third member of this
    group of  redundant 3' processing enzymes. Unlike Apn1 and Apn2, Tpp1 is specific
    for the  removal of 3' phosphates at strand breaks and does not possess more general
    3'  phosphodiesterase, exonuclease, or AP endonuclease activities. Deletion of
    TPP1 in  an apn1 apn2 mutant background dramatically increased the sensitivity
    of the double  mutant to DNA damage caused by H2O2 and bleomycin but not to damage
    caused by methyl  methanesulfonate. The triple mutant was also deficient in the
    repair of 3' phosphate  lesions left by Tdp1-mediated cleavage of camptothecin-stabilized
    Top1-DNA covalent  complexes. Finally, the tpp1 apn1 apn2 triple mutation displayed
    synthetic lethality  in combination with rad52, possibly implicating postreplication
    repair in the  removal of unrepaired 3'-terminal lesions resulting from endogenous
    damage. Taken  together, these results demonstrate a clear role for the lesion-specific
    enzyme,  Tpp1, in the repair of a subset of DNA strand breaks.

  title: Uncoupling of 3'-phosphatase and 5'-kinase functions in budding yeast. Characterization
    of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA 3'-phosphatase (TPP1)
  journal: J Biol Chem
  citation: 276(18):15073-81
  year: 2001
  url: ~
  abstract: Polynucleotide kinase is a bifunctional enzyme containing both DNA 3'-phosphatase  and
    5'-kinase activities seemingly suited to the coupled repair of single-strand  nicks
    in which the phosphate has remained with the 3'-base. We show that the yeast  Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae is able to repair transformed dephosphorylated linear  plasmids by
    non-homologous end joining with considerable efficiency independently of  the
    end-processing polymerase Pol4p. Homology searches and biochemical assays did  not
    reveal a 5'-kinase that would account for this repair, however. Instead, open  reading
    frame YMR156C (here named TPP1) is shown to encode only a polynucleotide  kinase-type
    3'-phosphatase. Tpp1p bears extensive similarity to the ancient  L-2-halo-acid
    dehalogenase and DDDD phosphohydrolase superfamilies, but is specific  for double-stranded
    DNA. It is present at high levels in cell extracts in a  functional form and so
    does not represent a pseudogene. Moreover, the  phosphatase-only nature of this
    gene is shared by Saccharomyces mikatae YMR156C and  Arabidopsis thaliana K15M2.3.
    Repair of 3'-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl lesions is thus  uncoupled in budding yeast
    as compared with metazoans. Repair of transformed  dephosphorylated plasmids,
    and 5'-hydroxyl blocking lesions more generally, likely  proceeds by a cycle of
    base removal and resynthesis.
